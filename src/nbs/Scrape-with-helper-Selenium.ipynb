State of Maharashtra', '[Criminal Appeal No._______ of 2024 arising out of SLP (Criminal) No. 13920 of 2024]', 'B.R. Gavai, J.', '1. Leave granted.', '2. The present appeal arises out of the final judgment and order dated 5th August, 2020, passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay (hereinafter, \"High Court\"), in Criminal Appeal No. 927 of 2015, whereby the High Court has negatived the challenge to the judgment and order dated 7th July, 2015, passed by the Court of Additional Sessions Judge - 3, at Satara (hereinafter, \"trial court\"), in Sessions Case No. 121 of 2014, thereby upholding the conviction for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter, \"IPC\") and the imposition of sentence to suffer imprisonment for life along with fine of Rs. 500/- on the appellant.', '3. By way of the present appeal, the appellant has called into question the dismissal of his Criminal Appeal by the High Court.', '4. The facts, in brief, giving rise to the present appeal are as given below.', \"4.1 The prosecution story is that on 21st March 2014, Sunita Bhosale (PW-6) and her husband Gopal Bhosale went to the house of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5). At that moment, Rajendra Bhosale had gone to answer nature's call. Sunita Bhosale (PW-6) and her husband were having a conversation with Chayya - wife of Rajendra Bhosale (PW- 5). At about 10:30 PM, Sunny @ Santosh (appellant) came in front of the house of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) and started abusing Chayya and Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) on account of a loan they had taken.\", 'When Chayya tried to pacify the appellant, he attempted to assault her. Seeing this, Gopal Bhosale intervened and requested the appellant not to use abusive language and that his grievance could be resolved the next day. The appellant went some distance away from the house of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) but then suddenly started abusing Gopal Bhosale in filthy language and called him out of the house in a threatening tone. Gopal Bhosale went out of the house and followed the appellant towards the Northern side of tar road leading towards Khadkoba Temple in the village.', 'It is then that the appellant beat and assaulted Gopal Bhosale particularly on his face and head by means of a bamboo stick causing bleeding injuries. Mangesh Bhosale (PW-3) and Aniket Bhosale (not examined), upon hearing the sound of quarrel so also Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) who was informed by Sunita Bhosale (PW-6) and his wife Chayya, rushed towards the spot and saw the appellant assaulting Gopal Bhosale by means of a bamboo stick and the injured lying on the ground. Seeing the three of them, the appellant ran away from there. Other people including Sharad Bhosale (PW-4) gathered at the spot. The injured Gopal Bhosale was taken to the Rural Hospital, Khandala, where the doctor declared him brought dead.', '4.2 Sharad Bhosale (PW-4) lodged the First Information Report being FIR No. 54 of 2014 at Police Station Khandala, District Satara, on the intervening night of 21st March 2014 and 22nd March 2014 at around 1:35 AM. The FIR was registered for offences punishable under Sections 302 and 504 of IPC.', '4.3 Investigating Officer Ashok Shelke (PW-10) conducted the investigation. After preparing the inquest panchnama, the dead body was sent for postmortem. The appellant was arrested. The blood-stained clothes of the appellant were seized by preparing a panchnama. While in police custody, the disclosure statement of the appellant was recorded and at his instance muddemal i.e., bamboo stick was seized under panchnama. The Investigating Officer also recorded the statement of witnesses. He sent blood-stained clothes, bamboo stick, etc., for chemical analysis.', '4.4 The Investigating Officer, upon completion of the investigation, filed a chargesheet forwarding the appellant to face the trial. The case was committed to the Sessions Court as the offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC is exclusively triable by the Sessions Court.', '4.5 The trial court, upon hearing, framed charge against the appellant. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.', '4.6 In order to bring home the guilt of the appellant, the prosecution examined ten witnesses. Besides the oral evidence, prosecution has also placed reliance on a number of documents. The incriminating circumstances in evidence were put to the appellant. The appellant denied the circumstances. He led no defence evidence. The defence was of total denial.', '4.7 The Sessions Court, upon trial, convicted the appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for life.', '4.8 Aggrieved thereby, the appellant preferred an appeal before the High Court. Vide impugned final judgment and order, the High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant. Aggrieved still, the appellant has filed the present appeal.', '5. We have heard Shri D.N. Goburdhun, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant and Shri Siddharth Dharmadhikari, learned Counsel appearing for the respondent- State.', '6. Shri D.N. Goburdhun, learned Senior Counsel, submits that the trial court as well as the High Court has grossly erred in convicting the appellant. It is submitted that the testimonies of the witnesses i.e. Mangesh Bhosale (PW-3), Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) and Sunita Bhosale (PW-6) would show that there are material contradictions and inconsistencies in their depositions. It is further submitted that there are various contradictions in the FIR on one hand and the testimonies of the alleged eyewitnesses. He, therefore, submits that the judgment and order of conviction is not at all sustainable in law.', '7. Shri Goburdhun in the alternative submits that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses itself would show that the incident was an outcome of a sudden and grave provocation in a quarrel that took place between the deceased and the appellant. It is, therefore, submitted that, in any event, the conviction under Section 302 IPC would not be sustainable and will have to be altered to a lesser offence.', '8. Shri Siddharth Dharmadhikari, learned Standing Counsel for the State of Maharashtra, on the contrary, submits that insofar as the material aspect is concerned, the testimonies of all the three eyewitnesses are consistent. He submits that apart from the testimonies of the eyewitnesses, the circumstantial evidence also points towards the guilt of the appellant. He, therefore, submits that no interference would be warranted with the concurrent judgments and orders passed by the trial court and the High Court.', '9. Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5), states in his deposition that, on the date of the incident the deceased and his wife Sunita Bhosale (PW-6) had come to his residence. He had gone to answer the call of the nature. When he returned, Sunita Bhosale (PW-6) and his wife were standing at the door. They informed that the appellant had come and was abusing the deceased and that the deceased had gone after him.', 'He then, went after them. When he went towards Khadkoba temple, he noticed that the deceased was lying on road near the house situated behind metal-sheet mansion and the appellant was assaulting him by means of bamboo stick. He states that Mangesh Bhosale (PW-3) and one Aniket Bhosale also came there. Seeing them, the appellant fled away. The deceased had become unconscious. The deceased was taken to the Government hospital where he was declared dead.', '10. The evidence of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) is sought to be corroborated by Mangesh Bhosale (PW-3). He stated that hearing the quarrelling noise on the rear side of his house he came out of the house and thereafter saw the appellant assaulting the deceased. However, the presence of this witness is itself doubtful, inasmuch as, Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) in his crossexamination admits that the house of Mangesh Bhosale (PW-3) is at a distance of 2000-2500 feet from the place of incident.', '11. The prosecution case is, however, also supported by Sunita Bhosale (PW-6), the wife of the deceased.', '12. Taking into consideration the evidence of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) and Sunita Bhosale (PW-6), we do not find any error in the finding of the trial court and the High Court that it is the present appellant who assaulted the deceased due to which the death of the deceased has occurred.', '13. The next question that arises for consideration is as to whether the conviction under Section 302 IPC would be sustainable or whether the appellant deserves to be convicted for a lesser offence.', \"14. In this respect, it will be relevant to refer to the testimony of Sunita Bhosale (PW-6), the wife of the deceased. She in her evidence states that, she and her husband deceased Gopal had gone to the house of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5). When they went to the house of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5), he had gone to answer nature's call. She further states that the accused appellant came there and started abusing Chayya and Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5).\", 'Thereafter, her husband tried to persuade the accused appellant telling him why he was abusing them, and they would see about his grievance in the morning. She states that thereafter the accused appellant started abusing her husband deceased Gopal due to his intervention. The accused appellant went from there and the deceased also went behind him. She further stated that she and Chayya, the wife of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) stood outside the house.', 'At that time, Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) also arrived. She states that, when Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) returned, she and Chayya told Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) about the incident stating that deceased Gopal had gone behind the accused appellant. She states that, thereafter Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) went towards Khadkoba temple. He was followed by Mangesh Bhosale (PW-3) and one Aniket Bhosale.', '15. From the testimony of Sunita Bhosale (PW-6) itself, it will be clear that after a scuffle took place at the house of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5), the accused appellant went from there and the deceased followed him. Thereafter, as to how the assault took place is not clear either from the evidence of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) or from the evidence of Sunita Bhosale (PW-6). It is however clear that after the accused appellant left the place, the deceased followed him. After that, as to what had happened between the deceased and the appellant is not clear from the evidence of the eyewitnesses.', \"16. From the evidence of Sunita Bhosale (PW-6) itself, it is clear that the deceased had nothing to do with the incident. The appellant had come to the house of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) where she and her husband had gone. Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) had gone to answer nature's call and three of them i.e. the deceased, Sunita Bhosale (PW-6) and Chayya, the wife of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5), were present there.\", 'The appellant started abusing Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5) and his wife Chayya. The deceased intervened and asked the appellant as to why he was abusing Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5). Irked by the intervention of the deceased, the appellant started abusing the deceased and thereafter went away. It is thus clear that no motive has come on record as to why the appellant wanted to commit the murder of the deceased.', '17. The evidence of the eyewitnesses also does not show that the appellant had come with any weapon. On the contrary, the medical evidence would show that the injuries caused are with the bamboo stick, which is commonly available in a village. The possibility of the deceased following the appellant and an altercation taking place between them and in a sudden fight in the heat of passion the appellant assaulting the deceased cannot be ruled out.', '18. As already discussed hereinabove, the prosecution has utterly failed to prove any case of premeditation. On the contrary, the case as put forth by the prosecution is about the appellant coming to the house of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5), abusing him and his wife Chayya, and the weapon used is a bamboo stick which is commonly available anywhere in the village. The nature of the injuries sustained by the deceased would also not show that the appellant had taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.', '19. In that view of the matter, we find that the appellant is entitled to benefit of doubt. The conviction of the appellant under Section 302 IPC, therefore, deserves to be altered to one under Part I of Section 304 IPC.', '20. We are, therefore, inclined to partly allow the present appeal.', '21. In the result, we pass the following order:', '(i) The appeal is partly allowed.', '(ii) The conviction of the appellant under Section 302 IPC is altered to the one under Part I of Section 304 IPC.', '(iii) The appellant has already undergone actual imprisonment for a period of more than 9 years and with remission he has undergone the sentence of more than 12 years prior to his release on bail by the order of this Court dated 4th October 2024. We, therefore, find that the said sentence would subserve the ends of justice. Therefore, the appellant is sentenced to the period already undergone.', '(iv) The bail bonds, if any, shall stand discharged.', '......................J. (B.R. Gavai)', '......................J.

The present appeal arises from the judgment and order dated 31st January 2019 passed by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in RSA No. 3818 of 1987. The High Court allowed the regular second appeal filed by the respondents herein (original plaintiffs), setting aside the judgment of the First Appellate Court and restoring the decree passed by the Trial Court in favour of the plaintiffs. Aggrieved by the High Court's decision, the appellants (original defendants), namely the State of Haryana and the Public Works Department (PWD), have preferred this appeal.\", '3. The facts of the case leading up to the present appeal are as follows:', '3.1 The dispute pertains to a piece of land measuring 18 Biswas Pukhta comprised in Khasra No. 2348 (0-10 Biswas) and Khasra No. 2458 (0-8 Biswas), situated within the revenue estate of Bahadurgarh, Haryana. The land is located on both sides of National Highway No. 10, which connects Delhi and Bahadurgarh.', '3.2. On 28th March 1981, the original plaintiffs, namely, Shri Amin Lal and Shri Ashok Kumar, filed a suit for possession of the suit property before the Court of Sub-Judge 1st Class, Bahadurgarh. They claimed ownership of the land based on revenue records and alleged that the defendants had unauthorizedly occupied the land approximately three and a half years prior to the filing of the suit. The plaintiffs contended that despite repeated requests and a legal notice served under Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the defendants failed to vacate the land.', '3.3. The defendants, the State of Haryana and PWD, contested the suit by filing a written statement dated 17th September, 1985. They raised preliminary objections, asserting that they had been in continuous and uninterrupted possession of the suit land since 1879-80. They claimed that their possession was open, hostile, and adverse to the plaintiffs, and as such, they had become owners by way of adverse possession. The defendants also contended that the land had been used as a store by the PWD and its predecessor entities, including the District Board and Zila Parishad, for over a century.', '3.4. Based on the pleadings, the Trial Court framed the following main issues:', '\"A. Whether the State of Haryana has become owner of the suit land by way of adverse possession? B. Whether the plaintiffs have no locus standi to file the present suit?\"', '3.5 The plaintiffs examined seven witnesses and produced revenue records, including copies of jamabandis (Exhibits P1 to P9). The defendants examined ten witnesses and produced various documents, including revenue records dating back to 1879-80 (Exhibits D1 to D22).', \"3.6. On 2nd May 1986, the Trial Court decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs. It held that the defendants had failed to prove that they had become owners by adverse possession. Mere placement of bitumen drums and construction of a boundary wall in 1980 did not constitute adverse possession. The plaintiffs had locus standi to file the suit, as they were recorded as owners in the jamabandis. The defendants' possession, if any, was permissive and not hostile.\", \"3.7. Aggrieved by the Trial Court's decision, the defendants filed an appeal before the District Judge, Rohtak. The First Appellate Court, after reappreciating the evidence, allowed the appeal on 8th October 1987 and dismissed the plaintiffs' suit. The Appellate Court held that:\", '3.8. The plaintiffs filed RSA No. 3818 of 1987 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, challenging the judgment of the First Appellate Court. The High Court framed the following substantial questions of law:', '\"I. Whether the State can set up the plea of adverse possession, and does it imply admitting the title of the plaintiffs?', 'II. Whether the judgment and decree of the Lower Appellate Court suffer from illegality and perversity?\"', 'The High Court allowed the appeal, holding that:', \"3.9. Aggrieved by the High Court's judgment, the defendants (now appellants) have approached this Court.\", '4. We have heard Shri Vikramjeet Banerjee, learned Additional Solicitor General for the Appellants and Shri Santosh Paul, learned Senior Counsel for the Respondents.', \"5. Mr. Vikramjeet Banerjee, learned A.S.G, appearing on behalf of the appellant the State of Haryana and its authorities, has argued that the High Court erred in overturning the wellreasoned judgment of the First Appellate Court, which had dismissed the plaintiffs' suit. The gist of his arguments is as follows:\", \"(i). Plaintiffs' Failure to Prove Title: The appellants assert that the plaintiffs did not produce any substantive evidence to establish their ownership of the suit property. Despite opportunities provided by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court, the plaintiffs failed to present any sale deeds or title documents. Mere reliance on jamabandi (revenue records) is insufficient to confer title, as revenue entries do not create or extinguish ownership rights.\", \"(ii). Burden of Proof Misplaced: The appellants further argue that the High Court incorrectly shifted the burden of proof onto the defendants to establish who the real owner is. In a suit for possession, the plaintiff must stand on the strength of their own title. The appellants cite precedents to emphasize that the weakness of the defendant's case cannot be a ground for granting relief to the plaintiffs.\", \"(iii). Adverse Possession and Limitation: While acknowledging that the State cannot claim adverse possession against a private individual, the appellants maintain that they have been in continuous, peaceful possession of the suit land since 1879. Under Section 110 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, such possession raises a presumption of ownership in their favor. Moreover, the plaintiffs' suit is barred by limitation under Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, as they failed to challenge the appellants' possession within the prescribed period.\", '(iv). Necessity of Declaratory Relief: The appellants contend that the plaintiffs should have filed a suit for declaration of title before seeking possession, especially when their ownership was in dispute. Without a declaratory decree establishing their title, the plaintiffs are not entitled to a decree for possession.', '(v). Conduct of the Plaintiffs: The appellants highlight that the First Appellate Court had termed the plaintiffs as \"land grabbers\" who manipulated revenue records to claim ownership. The High Court, however, did not address these observations or the detailed reasoning provided by the First Appellate Court.', '6. The arguments advanced on behalf of respondents by Shri Santosh Paul, learned Senior Advocate are summarized hereunder:', \"(i). Admission of Plaintiffs' Title by the Defendants: The respondents assert that the appellants did not specifically deny their ownership of the suit property in their written statement before the Trial Court. By taking the plea of adverse possession, the appellants implicitly admitted the respondents' title. Under Order VIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, failure to deny an allegation of fact amounts to an admission.\", \"(ii). State Cannot Claim Adverse Possession: The respondents argue that the State cannot perfect title over private property through adverse possession against its own citizens. Allowing such a claim would be contrary to the principles of a welfare State and undermine citizens' constitutional rights.\", '(iii). Permissive Possession by the State: The respondents contend that the appellants\\' possession of the suit land was permissive and not adverse. The Misal Hakiyat of 1879- 80 (Exhibit DW10/1) indicates that the State\\'s possession was conditional, described as \"Bikhar Bahali Kaza,\" meaning till the existence of an orchard. Acts such as placing bitumen drums or constructing temporary structures do not amount to adverse possession. The Trial Court rightly held that such acts do not constitute possession sufficient to establish adverse possession.', '(iv). Establishment of Ownership through Revenue Records: The respondents have established their ownership through continuous entries in the revenue records (jamabandis) from 1904-05 to 2019-20. Plaintiff No. 1 derived title through a registered sale deed dated 5th July 1960, and Plaintiff No. 2 through a sale deed dated 12th March 1973. Mutations were duly sanctioned based on these sale deeds. Revenue records are records of rights and are admissible evidence to prove ownership.', \"(v). Burden of Proof Lies on Defendants: Since the appellants did not deny the respondents' title, the burden was on the appellants to prove that they had become owners by adverse possession. The appellants failed to discharge this burden. The Trial Court correctly found that the appellants' possession, if any, began in 1980 and was insufficient to establish adverse possession.\", \"7. Having heard the arguments advanced by both parties and perused the records, the core issue before us is whether the High Court was correct in setting aside the judgment of the First Appellate Court and restoring the decree passed by the Trial Court in favour of the respondents (plaintiffs). The appellants challenge the High Court's decision on several grounds, which we shall address in their turn.\", '8. The appellants contention that plaintiff failed to prove their title and ownership is completely misplaced for the reasons and analysis made hereunder:', \"8.1 We find this argument unconvincing for several reasons: In their written statement before the Trial Court, the appellants did not specifically deny the plaintiffs' ownership of the suit property. Instead, they primarily relied on the plea of adverse possession. Under Order VIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, allegations of fact not denied specifically are deemed to be admitted. By asserting adverse possession, the appellants have impliedly admitted the plaintiffs' title.\", '8.2 The plaintiffs relied on jamabandi entries to establish their ownership. The jamabandi for the year 1969-70 (Exhibit P1) records the name of Shri Amin Lal as owner to the extent of half share. Revenue records are public documents maintained by government officials in the regular course of duties and carry a presumption of correctness under Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. While it is true that revenue entries do not by themselves confer title, they are admissible as evidence of possession and can support a claim of ownership when corroborated by other evidence.', '8.3 The respondents have produced copies of registered sale deeds and mutation records before this Court, which were part of the additional documents filed with the counteraffidavit. Plaintiff No. 1, Shri Amin Lal, derived title through a registered sale deed dated 5th July 1960, and mutation No. 8329 was sanctioned on 20th April 1982. Plaintiff No. 2, Shri Ashok Kumar, derived his title through a registered sale deed dated 12th March 1973, and mutation No. 8330 was sanctioned on 20th April 1982. These documents establish a chain of title and cannot be ignored.', \"8.4 The appellants did not dispute the plaintiffs' title in their pleadings or during the trial. The First Appellate Court's finding that the plaintiffs are not the true owners is based on conjecture and lacks evidentiary support. The appellants cannot now, at this appellate stage, challenge the plaintiffs' ownership without having raised a specific denial earlier.\", \"9. The appellants' next submission that the burden of proof lay on the plaintiffs to establish their title is equally not borne out from the records. It is a well-settled principle that in a suit for possession based on title, the plaintiffs must establish their ownership. In the present case, the plaintiffs have done so by producing revenue records and, subsequently, the registered sale deeds and mutation entries. Furthermore, as the appellants failed to deny the plaintiffs' title specifically and instead relied on adverse possession, the burden has shifted to the appellants to prove their adverse possession. In the present case, the plaintiffs have sought possession based on their title, which they have established through documentary evidence.\", '10. The appellants claim that due to their long and continuous possession of the suit property since 1879-80, they have perfected their title, is also not sustainable in law. However, it is a fundamental principle that the State cannot claim adverse possession over the property of its own citizens. In Vidya Devi v. State of H.P1, this Court emphatically held that the State cannot be permitted to take the plea of adverse possession. The relevant paragraphs from this judgement are reproduced hereunder:', '\"12.9. In a democratic polity governed by the rule of law, the State could not have deprived a citizen of their property without the sanction of law. Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in Tukaram Kana Joshi v. MIDC [Tukaram Kana Joshi v. MIDC, (2013) 1 SCC 353 : (2013) 1 SCC (Civ) 491] wherein it was held that the State must comply with the procedure for acquisition, requisition, or any other permissible statutory mode. The State being a welfare State governed by the rule of law cannot arrogate to itself a status beyond what is provided by the Constitution.', '12.10. This Court in State of Haryana v. Mukesh Kumar [State of Haryana v. Mukesh Kumar, (2011) 10 SCC 404 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 769] held that the right to property is now considered to be not only a constitutional or statutory right, but also a human right. Human rights have been considered in the realm of individual rights such as right to shelter, livelihood, health, employment, etc. Human rights have gained a multifaceted dimension.', '12.11. We are surprised by the plea taken by the State before the High Court, that since it has been in continuous possession of the land for over 42 years, it would tantamount to \"adverse\" possession. The State being a welfare State, cannot be permitted to take the plea of adverse possession, which allows a trespasser i.e. a person guilty of a tort, or even a crime, to gain legal title over such property for over 12 years. The State cannot be permitted to perfect its title over the land by invoking the doctrine of adverse possession to grab the property of its own citizens, as has been done in the present case.\"', '11. Allowing the State to appropriate private property through adverse possession would undermine the constitutional rights of citizens and erode public trust in the government. Therefore, the appellants\\' plea of adverse possession is untenable in law. The appellants\\' possession, as evidenced by the Misal Hakiyat of 1879-80 (Exhibit DW10/1), was permissive and conditional. The entry describes the possession as \"Bikhar Bahali Kaza,\" meaning till the existence of an orchard. Such permissive possession cannot be the basis for a claim of adverse possession.', \"12. Furthermore, the acts relied upon by the appellants-such as placing bitumen drums, erecting temporary structures, and constructing a boundary wall in 1980-do not constitute adverse possession. Adverse possession requires possession that is continuous, open, peaceful, and hostile to the true owner for the statutory period. In this case, the appellants' possession lacks the element of hostility and the requisite duration.\", \"13. The appellants last contention that the High Court overstepped its jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure by reappreciating evidence and interfering with findings of fact also has no legs to stand. The High Court had framed substantial questions of law regarding whether the State can claim adverse possession against its own citizens and whether taking the plea of adverse possession implies admission of the plaintiffs' title.\", \"These are substantial questions of law that justify the High Court's interference. The High Court found that the First Appellate Court had ignored material evidence and legal principles, leading to a perverse judgment. Therefore, the High Court was justified in exercising its jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\", '14. The findings of the First Appellate Court\\'s judgment are flawed for various reasons. The court erroneously placed the burden of proving ownership on the plaintiffs, despite the defendants\\' admission of their title by pleading adverse possession. The court disregarded the jamabandi entries and other revenue records without valid justification. The court\\'s conclusion that the plaintiffs are \"land grabbers\" is not supported by evidence and appears to be based on conjecture. Therefore, the High Court rightly set aside the First Appellate Court\\'s judgment, which suffered from legal infirmities and misappreciation of evidence.', \"15. In view of the above analysis, we find no merit in the appellants' contentions. The High Court's judgment is based on sound legal principles and correct appreciation of evidence. The plaintiffs have established their ownership of the suit property, and the State cannot claim adverse possession against its own citizens.\", '16. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.', '......................J. (Vikram Nath)', '......................J. (Prasanna B.Varale)', 'New Delhi', 'November 19, 2024', '1 (2020) 2 SCC 569', '']}\n",

Leave granted.', \"2. These are two appeals arising out of the impugned order dated 01.12.2022 passed by the Madras High Court in C.M.A. No.1539 of 2022, whereby the High Court has reduced the maintenance amount to be paid to the wife from Rs.1,75,000/-(Rupees One Lakh and Seventy-five thousand only) per month to Rs.80,000/- (Rupees Eighty Thousand only) per month. Both parties have challenged the said order of the High Court. The husband is the appellant in appeal @ SLP(C) No.4109/2023 and the wife is the appellant in appeal @ SLP(C) No.19922/2023. The husband is praying for further reduction of the maintenance amount and the wife is praying for enhancement of the same. For our purpose, the wife will be referred to as the 'appellant' and the husband as the 'respondent'.\", '3. The factual background of the present case is that the marriage between the appellant wife and respondent husband was solemnised on 15.09.2008 according to Christian customs. The respondent husband had one son from his previous marriage and there are no issues from this marriage. As the relations between the parties got estranged, on 19.03.2019, the respondent husband filed a petition for divorce being IDOP No.1284 of 2019 under Section 10(i) of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 stating that the parties have developed incompatibility. He alleged cruelty while citing various incidents and prayed for divorce.', '4. During the pendency of the divorce petition, the appellant wife herein filed an application being I.A No.1 of 2019 in IDOP No.1294 of 2019 before the Family Court, Chennai praying for maintenance of Rs.2,50,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh and Fifty Thousand only) per month along with litigation expenses amounting to Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh only). The wife claimed that the husband is a Cardiologist in MJ Hospital, Cochin and draws a salary of Rs.1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Fifty Thousand only) per month.', 'Plus, he has further income from a joint venture, by virtue of which he is earning a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Lakh only) per month. Further, he is earning rental income from his properties in Cochin to the tune of Rs.2,73,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh and Seventy Three Thousand only) and Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand only) from his house in Chennai. Additionally, it was claimed that he owns several other properties. The wife stated that she has a M.Sc. degree in Clothing and Textile and she worked in 2012 for about ten months. However, the husband was against her working and she was forced to leave her job.', '5. The Family Court, after evaluating the status, standard of living, income and assets of the parties, held that Rs.1,75,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Seventy Five Thousand only) per month would be a reasonable amount to be paid to the wife as interim maintenance and directed the respondent husband herein to pay the same, vide order dated 14.06.2022.', 'Aggrieved by this, the respondent husband filed an appeal being Civil Miscellaneous Appeal No. 1539 of 2022 before the Madras High Court challenging the same. The Madras High Court partially allowed the appeal vide impugned order dated 01.12.2022 by reducing the interim maintenance amount to Rs.80,000/- (Rupees Eighty Thousand only) per month, effective from the date of the petition, i.e. 03.07.2019 until the disposal of the divorce proceedings. It is this order which has given rise to the present appeals.', '6. We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties.', '7. The Family Court upon perusal of records and evidence on both sides in order to fix interim maintenance, found that it is clear that after desertion, the appellant wife had no other place to reside and thus, chose to seek shelter with her mother-in law, who is aged 93 years. Later on, considering the health of the aged mother-in law, the appellant wife started residing with her elder brother. Family Court also observed that the respondent husband failed to produce his income tax returns.', 'However, documents produced by the appellant and evidence of both parties in this regard would clearly reflect the fact that the respondent is a renowned expert in cardiology and has a number of worthful properties and is the only legal heir to his father who has passed away. His mother is running the age of 93. He is accruing all the incomes from the properties owned by his mother and himself and is also found to have been in possession of a school, though it is stated to be running in losses. However, the respondent did not come forward with any proof to this effect.', '8. The Family Court also noted that the respondent specifically stated that when the parties were residing together, he engaged two maids on 24x7 basis to aid them in their domestic work and maintenance and the appellant is accustomed to these comforts. The Family Court therefore compared the status, standard of life, income source, properties, its possession, rights and liabilities of the respondent and found that the appellant cannot be denied to enjoy the privileges as enjoyed by the respondent.', 'Upon this consideration, the Family Court found it reasonable to award a sum of Rs.1,75,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Seventy Five Thousand only) as interim maintenance to be paid to the appellant by the respondent per month from the date of the petition being 03.07.2019 till the disposal of the main divorce petition being OP 1284 of 2019.', '9. The High Court, on the other hand, while allowing the appeal of the husband and modifying the order of the Trial Court noted that the Hospital in Kerala agreed to pay a sum of Rs.1,25,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Twenty Five Thousand only) per month as salary to the respondent husband in 2017.', \"Further, the joint venture agreement is of the year 2015 and there is no evidence to suggest that the respondent was still receiving the said amount from the builder and that the sale consideration received by him cannot be treated as 'monthly income'. The Bank statements on record pertained to a few months in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the High Court stated that those do not assist them in determining the present income of the appellant and did not take those into consideration for the purpose of deciding the quantum of maintenance.\", '10. The High Court held that the respondent, being a Cardiologist, earned a monthly income of Rs.1,25,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Twenty Five Thousand only) is established and that he and his mother received a rent of Rs.2,73,301/- (Rupees Two Lakh Seventy Three Thousand and Three Hundred One only) per month, of which he received only half amount.', \"Based on these two considerations, the High Court concluded that the appellant wife established the respondent's income to at least Rs.2,50,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh and Fifty Thousand only) per month. The High Court took note of the fact that the appellant sacrificed her employment after the marriage and determined that the reasonable amount of interim maintenance to be one third of the respondent's income which was Rs.80,000/- (Rupees Eighty Thousand only) per month.\", '11. We find that the High Court has erred in reducing the quantum of maintenance to Rs.80,000/- (Rupees Eighty Thousand only) per month. The High Court has considered only two sources of income for the respondent. Firstly, the sum of Rs.1,25,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Twenty-Five Thousand only) that he earns from working as a Cardiologist at the Hospital. Secondly, the rent amount he and his mother receive from a property, of which the High Court has stated that he receives half the amount only.', 'However, the High Court has not dealt with the findings of the Family Court wherein the respondent is said to own a number of worthful properties and the fact that he is the only legal heir of his father. The Family Court found that the respondent is accruing all the incomes from the properties owned by his mother. The High Court has not dealt with the aspect of the number of properties owned by the respondent and looked at the rental income from one property. The Family Court also noted that the respondent was found to be in possession of a school and could not substantiate his claim that the school was running in losses.', 'Therefore, the High Court has overlooked certain aspects relating to the income of the respondent which were looked at by the Family Court. Further, it is also on record that the appellant is not working as she sacrificed her employment after the marriage. The appellant was accustomed to a certain standard of living in her matrimonial home and therefore, during the pendency of the divorce petition, is also entitled to enjoy the same amenities of life as she would have been entitled to in her matrimonial home.', '12. Consequently, we allow the appeal of the appellant wife and set aside the order of the Madras High Court dated 01.12.2022 and restore the order of the Family Court. The respondent husband is directed to pay a sum of Rs.1,75,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Seventy Five Thousand only) per month as interim maintenance as per the order of the Family Court dated 14.06.2022.', '13.

It may be mentioned that the disciplinary authority had appointed an enquiry authority to conduct the enquiry against the respondent. On 29.11.2011, respondent submitted his defence brief denying all the allegations totalling 20.', '7.2. Enquiry proceeding started on 24.05.2011 and concluded on 06.09.2011. Thereafter on 08.12.2011, the enquiry officer submitted the enquiry report to the disciplinary authority. Out of the 20 allegations, the enquiry officer held that 16 were proved; 3 were partly proved; and one not proved. The disciplinary authority vide the forwarding letter dated 17.12.2011 forwarded a copy of the enquiry report to the respondent calling upon him to respond thereto within 15 days from the date of receipt of the report.', '7.3. Respondent submitted his reply to the disciplinary authority on 15.01.2012 pointing out various flaws in the enquiry report and requesting the said authority to drop the proceeding.', '7.4. The disciplinary authority, however, passed order dated 07.03.2012 imposing the penalty of dismissal from service on the respondent. Respondent preferred an appeal against the order of penalty. However, by order dated 26.10.2012, the appeal of the respondent was dismissed. It was thereafter that respondent preferred a review petition which also came to be dismissed by the reviewing authority vide the order dated 16.01.2014.', '8. Aggrieved thereby, respondent preferred a writ petition before the High Court assailing the order of penalty dated 07.03.2012 as affirmed by the appellate authority vide the order dated 26.10.2012 and by the reviewing authority vide the order dated 16.01.2014. The writ petition was registered as W(S) No. 3446 of 2014. Vide the judgment and order dated 06.09.2016, a Single Bench of the High Court held that service of the respondent was extended till 01.10.2010 after his superannuation in the year 2003.', 'There was no further extension of service after 01.10.2010. Departmental (disciplinary) proceeding was initiated on 18.03.2011 when the chargesheet was issued by the disciplinary authority to the respondent which was admittedly after 01.10.2010. Therefore, the appellant bank i.e. SBI had no jurisdiction to initiate departmental (disciplinary) proceeding beyond 01.10.2010. That being the position, the order of penalty dated 07.03.2012, the order of the appellate authority dated 26.10.2012 and the order of the reviewing authority dated 16.01.2014 were set aside and quashed. Appellants were directed to extend consequential service benefits to the respondent.', '9. The aforesaid judgment and order dated 06.09.2016 passed by the Single Bench was assailed by the appellants before the Division Bench of the High Court in LPA No. 505 of 2016.', '9.1. Vide the judgment and order dated 11.02.2020, the Division Bench concurred with the view of the Single Bench and held that departmental (disciplinary) proceeding could not have been initiated and continued after superannuation of the respondent. Consequently, the Division Bench dismissed the letters patent appeal of the appellants as being devoid of any merit.', '10. Appellants had assailed the above findings before this Court by way of a special leave petition and on leave being granted, the present civil appeal came to be registered.', '11. Respondent has filed counter affidavit. While defending the judgments of the Single Bench and the Division Bench of the High Court, respondent has stated that he had joined service in the appellant bank on 08.06.1973. As per requirement of Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules, appellant bank had extended the service of the respondent on completion of 30 years of service from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. From 01.10.2010, no order, either oral or written, was issued by the appellant bank further extending the service of the respondent. Therefore, the master and servant relationship between SBI and the respondent came to be severed on 01.10.2010.', '11.1. During the extended period of service i.e. on 18.08.2009, appellant bank had issued a notice to the respondent alleging irregularities by the respondent in the sanction and in the following up of advances and demand draft purchase for the periods from 19.01.2006 to 29.10.2008 and from 23.01.2009 to 22.08.2009.', '11.2. Thereafter on 21.08.2009 respondent was placed under suspension.', '11.3. Respondent had exchanged several rounds of communication with the appellant bank to permit him to have access to documents relied upon by them while making the allegations against the respondent. In view of the documents being very voluminous, respondent had sought for time to submit his explanation which was declined by the appellant bank.', '11.4. Disciplinary authority vide the show cause notice dated 18.03.2011 informed the respondent that departmental (disciplinary) proceeding was being initiated against him on the articles of charges framed. Respondent has contended that initiation of disciplinary proceeding on 18.03.2011 was after expiry of the extended period of service of the respondent on 01.10.2010. Be that as it may, disciplinary authority had appointed an enquiry officer who conducted enquiry into the charges and thereafter submitted his report on 17.12.2011.', '11.5. On the basis of the enquiry report, disciplinary authority imposed the penalty of dismissal from service on the respondent vide the order of penalty dated 18.03.2011.', '11.6. It is the contention of the respondent that the disciplinary proceeding was initiated against him after expiry of the extended period of service i.e. post superannuation. Therefore, such a disciplinary proceeding and the consequential order of penalty, appellate order and review order are non est in the eye of law being void-ab-initio.', '12. Mr. Balbir Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants, submitted that while the respondent was in service, he had committed serious irregularities. In this connection, show cause notice was issued on 18.08.2009. Thereafter, a detailed departmental enquiry was held in which the respondent had fully participated. Enquiry officer in his report dated 17.12.2011 held that out of the 20 charges, 16 were proved and 3 partly proved. He elaborated the charges which were proved against the respondent and summarised the same as under:', 'a. sanctioned loans to his family members without obtaining prior approval.', 'b. sanctioned loans on false certificates bearing false local addresses.', \"c. unauthorisedly debited a customer's account to meet the margin requirement in the loan sanctioned to his son.\", 'd. disbursed various loans without completing the formalities of documentation.', 'e. took educational loans as a co-borrower along with his son and daughter, without approval.', 'f. disbursed loans in various accounts without obtaining documents.', 'g. allowed large value debits in 49 KCC accounts after the date of credit of waiver amounts under the scheme.', 'h. 9 cheques belonging to his wife and daughter were presented by him, which were later on dishonoured.', 'i. took cash under acknowledgment on 9 occasions from customers of the bank but did not credit money to their account.', '12.1. He further submitted that respondent would have attained the age of 60 years on 30.10.2012. In fact, this has been the consistent stand of the respondent throughout the departmental proceeding. The penalty order was issued on 07.03.2012 before the respondent had attained the age of 60 years on 30.10.2012.', '12.2. Learned senior counsel also argued that it was not the case of the respondent either in appeal or in review or even before the learned Single Judge that the departmental proceeding against him was initiated after his superannuation and therefore was void-ab-initio. He had assailed the order of penalty on various other grounds including on merit. Therefore, the High Court was not justified in allowing the challenge of the respondent on the unpleaded ground that the departmental proceeding was initiated against him after his superannuation. This aspect was also overlooked by the Division Bench.', '12.3. Referring to the stand taken by the respondent in the departmental enquiry as well as before the appellate authority that he was due to superannuate on 30.10.2012, Mr. Singh submits that the same is binding on him. In fact, appellant bank had paid subsistence allowance to the respondent even after 01.10.2010 right upto the date of dismissal from service which the respondent had accepted. Therefore, it is not open to the respondent to now contend that his service with the appellant bank had come to an end on 01.10.2010.', '12.4. Learned senior counsel also referred to Rule 19 of the Service Rules more particularly to sub-Rule (2) thereof and contends that there cannot be any automatic superannuation of an officer from the service of the appellant bank. Superannuation of an officer has to be sanctioned by the competent authority under Rule 19(2) of the Service Rules.', '12.5. Finally, Mr. Singh, learned senior counsel submits that the departmental proceeding against the respondent was initiated before he had retired from service. Therefore, in terms of the Rule 19(3) of the Service Rules, respondent was deemed to have continued in service of the appellant bank for the purpose of such departmental proceeding. In this connection, he has placed reliance on the decision of this Court in SBI Vs. C.B. Dhall1.', '13. Per contra, Mr. Vishwajit Singh, learned senior counsel for the respondent, submits that there is no error or infirmity in the impugned decision of the High Court.', '13.1. Learned senior counsel submits that the issue involved in the present case is quite simple: whether the appellant bank could have initiated disciplinary proceeding against the respondent after his superannuation.', \"13.2. He submits that respondent had completed 30 years of service in the appellant bank in the year 2003. Therefore in terms of Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules, he was due to superannuate on 26.12.2003. However, the appellant bank invoked the proviso to Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules and by recording reasons in writing extended the service of the respondent beyond 30 years from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. Thereafter, no further extension of service was granted by the appellant bank. As such, the respondent's service in the appellant bank had ceased with effect from 01.10.2010.\", '13.3. Though appellant bank had issued notice dated 18.08.2009 to the respondent alleging irregularities and had suspended him from service on 21.08.2009, departmental proceeding was initiated against the respondent in terms of Rule 68(1) of the Service Rules only on 18.03.2011 when the charge memo was issued, which was clearly after 01.10.2010. The factum of the respondent participating in the departmental proceeding or stating that he was due to superannuate on 30.10.2012 would be of no consequence. Further, payment of subsistence allowance by the appellant bank and acceptance of the same by the respondent would also not lead to extension of service of the respondent post 01.10.2010.', '13.4. Learned senior counsel for the respondent therefore submits that the order of penalty imposed by the appellant bank on the respondent is clearly void-ab-initio and the High Court had rightly interfered with the same. In support of his submissions, he has placed reliance on the following decisions:', '(i) UCO Bank Vs. Rajinder Lal Capoor2; and', '(ii) UCO Bank Vs. M.B. Motwani3,', '14. Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties have received the due consideration of the Court.', '15. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and upon perusal of the materials on record, we may briefly refer to the relevant provisions of the statutes governing the service condition of the respondent.', \"15.1. In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-Section(1) of Section 43 of the State Bank of India Act, 1955, the Central Board of the State Bank of India has made the State Bank of India Officers (Determination of Terms and Conditions of Service) Order, 1979 (briefly 'the Service Order' hereinafter) to determine certain terms and conditions of appointment and service of officers in the State Bank of India (SBI).\", \"Order 19 thereof deals with the age of retirement. Clause (1) of Order 19 says that an officer shall retire from the service of SBI on attaining the age of 58 years or upon the completion of 30 years' service or 30 years' pensionable service if he is a member of the Pension Fund, whichever occurs first. Thus, as per clause (1) of Order 19 of the Service Order, an officer of SBI shall retire from the service of the bank on the happening of three contingencies whichever occurs first. The three contingencies are:\", '(i) on attaining the age of 58 years; or', '(ii) upon completion of 30 years of service; or', '(iii) completed 30 years of pensionable service, if he is a member of the Pension Fund.', '15.2. Therefore, what this provision contemplates is that an officer of SBI shall retire from service on completion of any one of the three contingencies whichever happens first. The first proviso confers a discretion upon the competent authority to extend the period of service of an officer who has either attained the age of 58 years or has completed 30 years of service or has completed 30 years of pensionable service, if it is deemed that such extension is desirable in the interest of SBI. However, the extended period of service shall not be counted for the purpose of pension.', '15.3. As per clause (2) of Order 19, no officer of SBI who has ceased to be in the service of SBI by virtue of any of the contingencies provided for in clause (1), shall be deemed to have retired from the service of the said bank for the purpose of the Pension and Guarantee Fund Rules or the Pension Fund Rules unless such cessation of service has been sanctioned on retirement for the purpose of either of the aforesaid two rules.', '15.4. Clause (3) of Order 19 makes it clear that in case disciplinary proceeding under the relevant rules of service has been initiated against an officer before he ceases to be in the service of SBI, the disciplinary proceeding may, at the discretion of the Managing Director, be continued after cessation of service and concluded by the authority which had initiated the same as if the officer continues in service. However, such an officer shall be deemed to be in service only for the purpose of continuance and conclusion of such proceeding.', '15.5. A conjoint reading of the three clauses of Order 19 would indicate that an officer of SBI shall retire from the service of the said bank on fulfilment of either of the three conditions. However, the competent authority has the discretion to extend the period of service of such an officer, if such extension is deemed desirable in the interest of SBI though the extended period of service will not be counted for the purpose of pension. Under clause (2), no officer who has ceased to be in the service of SBI by virtue of the contingencies stipulated in clause (1), shall be deemed to have retired from service for the purpose of the Pension and Guarantee Fund Rules or the Pension Fund Rules unless such cessation of service has been sanctioned.', 'Therefore, the sanctioning of cessation of service is only for the purpose of the aforesaid rules. Clause (3) contains the clarification that if disciplinary proceeding has been initiated against such an officer under the relevant service rules before he ceases to be in the service of SBI, the disciplinary proceeding may be continued and concluded by the authority which had initiated the same even post cessation of service of the officer. However, he shall be deemed to be in service only for the purpose of continuance and conclusion of such proceeding and not for any other purpose.', \"16. Now let us turn to the State Bank of India Officers' Service Rules, 1992 (already referred to as 'the Service Rules'). Preamble to the Service Rules says that the said rules have been framed by the Central Board of the State Bank of India exercising powers conferred by sub-Section(1) of Section 43 of the State Bank of India Act, 1955 to determine the terms and conditions of appointment and service of all officers in the State Bank of India. The Service Rules came into effect from 01.01.1992.\", \"16.1. Rule 2(1) says that the Service Rules shall apply to all officers of SBI who are appointed or promoted to any of the grades mentioned in Rule 4 and also to whom any of the rules mentioned thereunder are applicable. The rules include the State Bank of India Officers' (Determination of Terms and Conditions of Service) Order, 1979 (already referred to as 'the Service Order' hereinbefore). Rule 19 deals with retirement. As per Rule 19(1), an officer shall retire from the service of SBI on attaining the age of 60 years or upon the completion of 30 years of service or 30 years of pensionable service, if he is a member of the Pension Fund, whichever occurs first.\", 'The first proviso says that the competent authority, may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend the period of service of an officer who has completed 30 years of service or 30 years of pensionable service, as the case may be, should such extension be deemed desirable in the interest of the bank. However, the second proviso clarifies that an officer who has attained the age of 60 years shall not be granted any further extension in service.', '16.2. From a comparative analysis of Order 19(1) of the Service Order with Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules, what is discernible is that the only change introduced by the latter is in one of the conditions of superannuation i.e. the age. From 58 years it has now become 60 years. Rest of the provision has remained unaltered, including the contingencies of superannuation. Whether it is 58 or 60 years, it is only one of the contingencies of superannuation, not the sole.', 'Before attaining the age of 58 years or 60 years, as the case may be, an officer shall superannuate from service if he has completed 30 years of service or 30 years of pensionable service. However, the second proviso has made a clarification that an officer who has attained the age of 60 years shall not be granted any further extension in service. This means that an officer can be superannuated before attaining the age of 60 years if any one of the other two contingencies are fulfilled; he may also be granted extension of service thereafter but such extension of service cannot be beyond the age of 60 years.', \"16.3. Rule 19(2), on the other hand, starts with a nonobstante clause. It says that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Service Rules, no officer who has ceased to be in the bank's service by the operation of, or by virtue of, any provision shall be deemed to have retired from the service of SBI for the purpose of the Imperial Bank of India Employees' Pension and Guarantee Fund Rules or the State Bank of India Employees' Pension Fund Rules unless such cessation of service has been sanctioned as retirement for the purpose of either of the said pension fund rules as may be applicable to him. Thus what Rule 19(2) contemplates is sanctioning of cessation of service for the purpose of the aforesaid two rules only and for no other purpose.\", '16.4. Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 19 provides that in case disciplinary proceeding under the relevant rules of service has been initiated against an officer before he ceases to be in the service of SBI by operation of, or by virtue of, any of the said rules or the provisions of the Service Rules, the disciplinary proceeding may at the discretion of the competent authority, be continued and concluded by the authority by which the proceeding was initiated in the manner provided in the said rules post cessation of service as if the officer continues to be in service; but he shall be deemed to be in service only for the purpose of continuance and conclusion of such proceeding.', '17. Chapter XI of the Service Rules deals with conduct, discipline and appeal. Chapter XI comprises of Rule 50 to Rule 70.', '17.1. Section 2 of Chapter XI deals with discipline and appeal. Rule 67, which is part of Section 2, provides for various categories of minor and major penalties which may be imposed on an officer for an act of misconduct or for any other good and sufficient reason to be recorded in writing.', '17.2. The heading of Rule 68 which is also part of Chapter XI is decision to initiate and procedure for disciplinary action. Rule 68(1) says that the disciplinary authority either by itself or on a direction of the superior authority may institute disciplinary proceeding against an officer. The disciplinary authority or any authority higher than it may impose any of the penalties mentioned in Rule 67 on such an officer.', '17.3. As per Rule 68(2), no order imposing any of the major penalties shall be made except after an inquiry held in accordance with Rule 68(2). Clause (iii) of sub-Rule (2) of Rule 68 says that where it is proposed to hold an inquiry, the disciplinary authority shall frame definite and distinct charges on the basis of the allegations against the officer and the articles of charge(s) together with the statement of allegations on which those are based, list of documents and witnesses relied on, copies of relied upon documents to the extent possible and the statement of witnesses shall be communicated in writing to the officer who shall be required to submit within such time as may be specified by the disciplinary authority, a written statement of his defence.', '17.4. Thereafter, the procedure for conducting inquiry is laid down.', '17.5. Rule 69 provides for appeal and review. As per sub- Rule (1), an officer may appeal to the appellate authority against an order imposing upon him any of the penalties specified in Rule 67 or against an order of suspension. The procedural part of such an appeal is provided in sub-Rule (2).', '17.6. Rule 69(3) deals with review. Clause (i) thereof, which starts with a non-obstante clause, says that notwithstanding anything contained in Section 2, the reviewing authority may call for the record of the case within six months of the date of the final order and after reviewing the case, pass such order(s) thereon as it may deem fit.', '18. In Union of India Vs. K.V. Jankiraman4, this Court was examining the impact of sealed cover procedure on an employee due for promotion, increment etc. In that case, the employees were eligible for promotion but because of pending disciplinary proceeding, were subjected to sealed cover procedure. It was in that context that this Court considered amongst others the question as to what is the date from which it can be said that a disciplinary proceeding is pending against an employee. After due analysis, this Court held that it is only when a charge memo is issued to the employee that it can said a departmental (disciplinary) proceeding is initiated against the employee.', '19. This issue was again considered by this Court in Rajinder Lal Capoor (supra). Respondent in that case was an officer of the UCO Bank. Following a disciplinary proceeding, he was dismissed from service. However, the High Court in writ jurisdiction converted the punishment of removal from service into one of compulsory retirement with effect from the date of superannuation. UCO Bank came up in appeal following leave granted before this Court. On examining, this Court while opining that the High Court may not have been correct in converting the penalty of removal from service to compulsory retirement, however, came to the conclusion that initiation of departmental proceeding itself was wholly illegal and without jurisdiction.', \"The chargesheet was issued on 13.11.1998 whereas the respondent had attained the age of superannuation on or before 01.11.1996. Referring to the relevant provision i.e. Regulation 20(3)(iii) of the UCO Bank Officer Employees' Service Regulations, 1979 which created a legal fiction of continuance in service of the concerned officer post superannuation if disciplinary proceeding had been initiated prior to superannuation, such continuance of service being only for the purpose of conclusion of the disciplinary proceeding, this Court held that such a provision could be invoked only when the disciplinary proceeding had clearly been initiated prior to the respondents' ceasing to be in service.\", 'Only when a valid departmental proceeding is initiated against the officer while in service, despite his attaining the age of superannuation, the disciplinary proceeding can be allowed to be continued on the basis of the legal fiction as if he was in service. Thus, when a departmental proceeding is continued by reason of the legal fiction, the delinquent officer would be deemed to be in service although he has reached his age of superannuation. Reiterating the view taken in K.V. Jankiraman(supra), this Court held that the departmental proceeding is not initiated merely by issuance of a show cause notice.', 'It is initiated only when a chargesheet is issued. In the facts of that case, since the disciplinary proceeding was initiated after the age of superannuation, the chargesheet, inquiry report and the order of punishment were held to be illegal and without jurisdiction by this Court and those were set aside. Consequently, all retiral benefits due to the respondent was directed to be paid.', '20. Similarly in Coal India Ltd. Vs. Saroj Kumar Mishra5, this Court again reiterated the legal position that a departmental proceeding is ordinarily said to be initiated only when a chargesheet is issued.', \"21. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Canara Bank Vs. D.R.P. Sundharam6 examined the meaning and effect of Regulation 20(3)(iii) of the Canara Bank (Officers') Service Regulations, 1979 which is pari materia to Regulation 20(3)(iii) of the UCO Bank Officer Employees' Services Regulations, 1979 in the light of the view taken in Rajinder Lal Capoor (supra) and held that Regulation 20(3)(iii) is a stand-alone provision.\", 'By virtue of the said provision, a disciplinary proceeding initiated by means of a chargesheet prior to the retirement of a bank employee would continue even after his retirement in view of the provision contained in Regulation 20(3)(iii). In the facts of that case, the Bench noted that disciplinary proceeding was initiated by submission of chargesheet after the retirement of the respondent. Therefore, while confirming the decision of the High Court, this Court dismissed the appeal filed by Canara Bank.', '22. In the case of M.B. Motwani (supra), Supreme Court once again reiterated the position that a departmental proceeding is not initiated merely on issuance of a show cause notice. It is initiated only when a chargesheet is issued because that is the date of application of mind on the allegations levelled against an employee by the competent authority. In that case, it was noticed that the deceased employee had attained the age of superannuation on 31.07.1991 whereas the chargesheet was issued to him on 07.12.1991 meaning thereby that on the date of his superannuation, no disciplinary proceeding was pending against him. That being the position, this Court dismissed the appeal filed by UCO Bank.', '23. Having surveyed the relevant legal provisions and the case law, let us now revert back to the essential undisputed facts of the case. Respondent was appointed in the SBI as a clerk typist on 08.06.1973. In due course of time, he rose through the ranks and reached managerial position. On completion of 30 years of service, he was due to superannuate on 26.12.2003. Exercising powers under Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules, respondent was granted extension of service vide order dated 05.08.2023 from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. On 18.08.2009, a notice was issued to the petitioner wherein and whereby serious irregularities allegedly committed by him were highlighted and his response was sought for.', 'On 21.08.2009, respondent was placed under suspension. Though respondent had submitted his reply to the notice dated 18.08.2009 on 27.10.2009, it appears that the disciplinary authority did not accept such reply and decided to initiate disciplinary proceeding against the respondent by issuing show cause notice dated 18.03.2011 under Rule 68(1) of the Service Rules. Alongwith the show cause notice, articles of charges and the statement of allegations on the basis of which the charges were framed, were sent to the respondent. There is nothing on record to show further continuance of service by the respondent beyond 01.10.2010. As noted above, service of the respondent was extended from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010.', '24. From the above, it is evident that charge memo was issued to the respondent on 18.03.2011 after his extension of service was over on 01.10.2010. This is an undisputed jurisdictional fact.', '25. Appellants have contended that respondent was paid subsistence allowance from his date of suspension i.e. 21.08.2009 till his dismissal from service vide order dated 07.03.2012 beyond 01.10.2010. Besides it was the case of the respondent himself before the enquiry officer, disciplinary authority as well as before the appellate authority that he was due to superannuate on 30.10.2012. He also did not plead either before the said authorities or before the High Court that he had ceased to be in service of SBI from 01.10.2010 and therefore the disciplinary proceeding initiated thereafter on 18.03.2011 was void-ab-initio. As such the learned Single Judge was not justified in accepting the challenge of the respondent to the order of penalty on a completely different ground.', '26. We are afraid we cannot accept such a contention on behalf of the appellants. Where the disciplinary proceeding itself is without jurisdiction, upholding the same on the specious plea that it was not challenged on the ground of lack of jurisdiction would be tantamount to giving imprimatur to a patently illegal proceeding. This aspect was gone into by the learned Single Judge in the following manner:', '6. After hearing learned counsel for the respective parties at length and on perusal of the records, I am of the considered view that the petitioner has been able to make out a case for interference due to the following facts and reasons stated hereinbelow: (I) Indisputably, on completion of 30 years of service in the year 2003, the services of the petitioner was extended till 01.10.2010 as per the State Bank of India officers (determination of term & conditions of services 1979). The alleged charges pertains to the extension period of the petitioner as Branch Manager, SBI, Tangerbansali Branch, Ranchi during the period 19.01.2006 to 29.10.2008 and 23.01.2009 to 22.08.2009.', 'After submission of explanation to the alleged charges, the disciplinary authority decided to initiate departmental proceeding vide letter dated 18.03.2011 containing article of charges. In the disciplinary proceeding the order of dismissal has been passed under Rule 67(j) of the SBI Officers Service Rules which has been affirmed by the appellate as well as revisional authority. Admittedly, there has not been extension of service after 01.10.2010 nor any provision of relevant rules has been brought to the notice of this Court as to what would be effect the disciplinary proceeding after retirement.', 'When there is no express order by the respondent bank for extension of services after 01.10.2010, the said date is to be treated as the date of retirement in usual course. In the instant case, the charge sheet was issued on 18.03.2011 after the date of deemed retirement of the petitioner when there was no specific order by the banking authorities for extension of services. Therefore, on that score, the impugned order of dismissal dated 07.03.2012 passed by the appointing authority being affirmed by the appellate authority as well as reviewing authorities being not legally sustainable is liable to be quashed.', \"The view of this Court gets fortified by the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India Vs. J. Ahmad reported in 1979 (2) SCC 286 which still holds the fields the entire departmental proceeding initiated against the petitioner after non-extension of service in terms of State Bank of India Officers (Determination of Terms and Conditions of Service) Order, 1979 as substituted on 23.02.1984 and State Bank of India Officers Service Rules, 1992 the relationship of master and servant has come to an end after 01.10.2010.\", 'Therefore, the respondent bank had no jurisdiction to initiate departmental proceeding without extension of services of the petitioner beyond 01.10.2010. Apart from the aforesaid legal of provision in the instant case as apparent from the pleadings of the parties the bank has not suffered any pecuniary loss for any act of omission or commission on the part of petitioner. In the aforesaid backdrop of fact the initiation of departmental proceeding and imposition of extreme punishment of dismissal from services is unreasonable, illegal and not legally sustainable.', '27. When the appellants approached the Division Bench of the High Court in letters patents appeal, the Division Bench repelled the contention of the appellants and held as follows:', \"11. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant Bank that as per the Rule 19(1) of the State Bank of India Officers' Service Rules, 1992, the respondent writ petitioner was to superannuate on completion of 60 years of age, is again, not in consonance with the Rules. The relevant portion of Rule 19(1) of the aforesaid Rules reads as follows:-\", '\"19.(1) An officer shall retire from the service of the Bank on attaining the age of sixty years or upon the completion of thirty years\\' service or thirty years\\' pensionable service, if he is a member of the Pension Fund, whichever occurs first.\"', 'A bare perusal of the Rule clearly shows that if an officer of the State Bank of India, completes thirty years of service prior to attaining the age of 60 years, he is to superannuate from service, on completion of thirty years of service, irrespective of the fact that he has not attained the age of 60 years.', '12. In the case of the writ petitioner, he was made to superannuate on the date of completion of 30 years of service in the year 2003 itself, and he was again given an extension of service from 27.12.2003 to 1.10.2010. As such, by no stretch of imagination, it can be said that even in case of extension of service given to the respondent writ petitioner beyond the period of 30 years of service, he was to continue in service till he attained the age of 60 years.', \"No other Rule has been brought on record, or to the notice of this Court to show that even after completion of 30 years of service, the officer of the Bank shall continue in service, till he attains the age of 60 years. Rule 19(1) of the State Bank of India Officers' Service Rules, 1992, is absolutely clear, without any ambiguity, wherein there is no scope of accepting the submission of learned counsel for the appellant Bank.\", '13. Thus, the only conclusion that can be drawn in the present case, is that the writ petitioner could not have been allowed to continue in service after 1.10.2010, in absence of any further extension of service, which admittedly was not done in the present case. In that view of the matter, we find that the departmental proceeding had been initiated and the punishment order was passed after the superannuation of the petitioner on 1.10.2010, as the initiation of the departmental proceeding was done on 18.03.2011, and the punishment order was passed by the Disciplinary Authority on 7.03.2012, i.e., after the date of superannuation, which was not permissible in the eyes of law, in absence of any disciplinary Rules. Admittedly, no such Rules were brought to the notice of the Writ Court, or to the notice of this Court.', '14. As such, we find no illegality in the impugned Judgment dated 6.9.2016, passed by the Writ Court in W.P.(S) No.3446 of 2014, holding that the departmental proceeding could not have been initiated and continued after the superannuation of the respondent writ petitioner, and allowing the writ application, quashing the order of dismissal from service passed by the Disciplinary Authority, as well as the orders of the Appellate and the Reviewing Authorities, worth any interference in exercise of the LPA jurisdiction.', '28. In so far the present case is concerned, respondent was due to superannuate on 26.12.2003 apparently on completion of 30 years of service but his service was extended on 05.08.2003 from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. Thus, the extended service of the respondent came to an end on 01.10.2010. The relationship of master and servant between the appellants and the respondent came to be severed on and from 01.10.2010. The factum of receipt of subsistence allowance thereafter or the respondent declaring that he would superannuate on a later date i.e. on 30.10.2012 on attaining the age of 60 years would not make any difference to the legal and factual scenario. Therefore, it is evident that respondent was no longer in the service of SBI post 01.10.2010.', '29. Attaining 60 years of service (earlier 58 years) is not the sole criterion of superannuation of an officer serving in SBI. As already noted and discussed above, it is one of the three contingencies. If any of the three contingencies are fulfilled, an officer would be superannuated. Respondent had actually superannuated from service in SBI on 26.12.2003 on completion of 30 years of service but his service was extended prior thereto on 05.08.2003 from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. Post 01.10.2010 there was no further extension of service.', '30. Disciplinary proceeding against the respondent was not initiated on 18.08.2009 when the first notice to show cause was issued but was initiated only on 18.03.2011 when the disciplinary authority issued the charge memo to the respondent.', '31. As has been held by this Court on more than one occasion, a subsisting disciplinary proceeding i.e. one initiated before superannuation of the delinquent officer may be continued post superannuation by creating a legal fiction of continuance of service of the delinquent officer for the purpose of conclusion of the disciplinary proceeding (in this case as per Rule 19(3) of the Service Rules). But no disciplinary proceeding can be initiated after the delinquent employee or officer retires from service on attaining the age of superannuation or after the extended period of service.', '32. Even in the case of C.B. Dhall (supra) relied upon by the appellants, this Court while considering the purport of Rule 20B of the State Bank of India (Supervising Staff) Service Rules, 1975 held that under Rule 20B disciplinary proceeding, if initiated against an employee before he retires from service, could be continued and concluded even after his retirement and for the purpose of conclusion of the disciplinary proceeding, the employee is deemed to have continued in service but for no other purpose.', '33. That being the position, we see no merit in the appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. Appellants are directed to release all the service dues of the respondent expeditiously and at any rate not later than six weeks from today.', '......................J. [Abhay S.

State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.', '[Civil Appeal No(s)._______ of 2024 arising out of SLP (Civil) No(s). 29758 of 2018]', 'Mehta, J.', '1. Leave granted.', '2. The instant appeal arises from the judgment dated 30th July, 2018 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, allowing the Writ Petition preferred by the respondents and setting aside the judgment dated 5th June, 2015 passed by the State Public Services Tribunal, Lucknow1, whereby, the Tribunal had allowed the Claim Petition2 preferred by the appellant.', 'Brief facts:-', '3. The appellant, while being posted as Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Tax, Khand-13, Ghaziabad faced disciplinary proceedings in furtherance of a charge sheet dated 5th March, 2012. The Inquiry Officer conducted the inquiry and submitted an Inquiry Report dated 29th November, 2012. The Disciplinary Authority being the Principal Secretary, Tax Registration Department, Lucknow, U.P., issued a Show Cause Notice accompanied with the Inquiry Report to the appellant. The appellant submitted his reply/objections to the said Show Cause Notice. The Disciplinary Authority, considered the reply of the appellant and issued the Order dated 5th November, 2014, whereby it awarded the punishment of Censure Entry as well as stoppage of two grade increments with cumulative effect to the appellant.', '4. The appellant challenged the order imposing penalty by filing the Claim Petition3 before the Tribunal which allowed the same vide order dated 5th June, 2015; thereby, quashing the order dated 5th November, 2014 and directed that the appellant shall be entitled to all consequential benefits. While allowing the Claim Petition, the Tribunal came to the following conclusions:-', '\"While going through the record available on the file it becomes clear that the Inquiry Officer proved the charges against the petitioner merely, on the basis of conclusion of the verification report prepared under Deputy Collector and the Additional Commissioner, Grade-1, Commercial Tax, Agra Zone, Agra. The delinquent officer was not involved in the inquiry. The petitioner submitted detailed explanation to the show cause notice but when we go through the punishment order and the explanation submitted by the petitioner against the show cause notice, we find that proper analysis and deliberation was not done by the opp.(sic) parties to assess the role of the petitioner in the episode.', 'The finding recorded by the Inquiry Officer on the relevant charges can be safely termed as irrational. No reasons have been given for recording those findings. The Inquiry Officer has recorded cryptic findings and concluded that the charges are proved without rationalizing those conclusions. Hence it is a fit case where the Tribunal should interfere. We may also add here that this is not a case of procedural irregularity, and we do not propose to interfere with the order of the disciplinary authority on the ground of procedural irregularity. On the basis of the discussion attempted in the preceding para we are fully convinced that the Inquiry Officer and the Disciplinary have recorded irrational findings on relevant charges.\"', '(emphasis supplied)', '5. The State/disciplinary authority assailed the order4 passed by the Tribunal by filing Writ Petition5 which was allowed vide judgment dated 30th July, 2018 and the order passed by the Tribunal was set aside thereby reaffirming the order issued by the disciplinary authority which had imposed penalty. The appellant herein has assailed the judgment dated 30th July, 2018 passed by the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction by preferring this appeal by special leave.', 'Submission on behalf the appellant:-', '6. Learned counsel representing the appellant urged that the inquiry proceedings conducted against the appellant were in gross dereliction of Rule 7(3) of the Uttar Pradesh Government Servant(Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 19996. The disciplinary proceedings were initiated and allegations constituting major penalty were proposed by Inquiry Officer. Since the appellant had emphatically denied the charges, it was incumbent upon the Inquiry Officer to have recorded evidence to establish the charges attributed to the appellant.', 'However, admittedly, not a single witness was examined by the Inquiry Officer to bring home the charges, and thus, the inquiry report is non est in the eyes of law. He, therefore, urged that the Tribunal was perfectly justified in quashing the inquiry proceedings and the order imposing penalty vide order dated 5th June, 2015 and that the High Court fell in grave error of law whilst allowing the writ petition and reversing the order passed by the Tribunal. He, therefore, implored the Court to accept the appeal, set aside the judgment passed by the High Court and restore the order passed by the Tribunal.', 'Submissions on behalf of the respondent-State:-', '7. Per contra, learned standing counsel appearing for the State vehemently and fervently opposed the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the appellant. He contended that the appellant did not seriously challenge the findings of the Inquiry Officer in the Inquiry Report.', 'The reply submitted by the appellant was considered by the Disciplinary Authority and after due application of mind, the Disciplinary Authority passed a well-reasoned Order dated 5th November, 2014 imposing the penalty afore-stated against the appellant. He submitted that the High Court exercised the jurisdiction conferred upon it by virtue of Article 226 of the Constitution of India by proper consideration of the material available on record and hence, this Court should not interfere with the impugned judgment rendered by the High Court.', '8. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced at bar and have carefully gone through the impugned judgments and the material available on record.', 'Discussion and Conclusion:-', '9. There is no dispute amongst the parties that penalty which has been imposed upon the appellant is a major penalty as defined in the Rules of 1999. In Rule 37 of the Rules of 1999, under the head of major penalty, the first Sub-Rule refers to withholding of increments with cumulative effect.', '10. Therefore, Rule 7 of the Rules of 1999 which prescribes the procedure for imposing major penalty would be applicable in the inquiry to be conducted against the appellant to bring home the charges imputed to him.', '11. Rule 7 (vii)8 of the Rules of 1999, clearly stipulates that where a Government servant denies the charge, the Inquiry Officer shall proceed to call the witness proposed in the charge sheet and record their oral evidence in the presence of the charged Government servant who shall be given opportunity to cross-examine such witness. After recording the aforesaid evidence, the Inquiry Officer shall call and record the oral evidence which the charged Government servant desires in his written statement to be produced in his defence. Hence, recording of oral evidence in support of charges against Government servant is a mandate under of Sub-rule (vii) of Rule 7 of the Rules of 1999, when the inquiry being conducted proposes imposition of a major penalty.', \"12. Learned counsel for the State was ad idem to the submissions of the appellant's counsel that no witness whatsoever was examined during the course of the inquiry proceedings. On a minute appraisal of the Inquiry Report, it is evident that other than referring to the documents pursuant to the so-called irregular transactions constituting the basis of the inquiry, the Inquiry Officer failed to record the evidence of even a single witness in order to establish the charges against the appellant.\", '13. This Court in a catena of judgments has held that the recording of evidence in a disciplinary proceeding proposing charges of a major punishment is mandatory. Reference in this regard may be held to Roop Singh Negi v. Punjab National Bank and Others9 and Nirmala J. Jhala v. State of Gujarat and Another.10', '14. In the case of Roop Singh Negi11, this Court held that mere production of documents is not enough, contents of documentary evidence have to be proved by examining witnesses.', 'Relevant extract thereof reads as under:-', '\"14. Indisputably, a departmental proceeding is a quasijudicial proceeding. The enquiry officer performs a quasijudicial function. The charges levelled against the delinquent officer must be found to have been proved. The enquiry officer has a duty to arrive at a finding upon taking into consideration the materials brought on record by the parties. The purported evidence collected during investigation by the investigating officer against all the accused by itself could not be treated to be evidence in the disciplinary proceeding. No witness was examined to prove the said documents. The management witnesses merely tendered the documents and did not prove the contents thereof. Reliance, inter alia, was placed by the enquiry officer on the FIR which could not have been treated as evidence.', '15. We have noticed hereinbefore that the only basic evidence whereupon reliance has been placed by the enquiry officer was the purported confession made by the appellant before the police. According to the appellant, he was forced to sign on the said confession, as he was tortured in the police station. The appellant being an employee of the Bank, the said confession should have been proved. Some evidence should have been brought on record to show that he had indulged in stealing the bank draft book. Admittedly, there was no direct evidence. Even there was no indirect evidence. The tenor of the report demonstrates that the enquiry officer had made up his mind to find him guilty as otherwise he would not have proceeded on the basis that the offence was committed in such a manner that no evidence was left.', '19. The judgment and decree passed against the respondent in Narinder Mohan Arya case [(2006) 4 SCC 713 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 840] had attained finality. In the said suit, the enquiry report in the disciplinary proceeding was considered, the same was held to have been based on no evidence. The appellant therein in the aforementioned situation filed a writ petition questioning the validity of the disciplinary proceeding, the same was dismissed. This Court held that when a crucial finding like forgery was arrived at on evidence which is non est in the eye of the law, the civil court would have jurisdiction to interfere in the matter. This Court emphasised that a finding can be arrived at by the enquiry officer if there is some evidence on record.\"', '(emphasis supplied)', '15. Same view was reiterated in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Saroj Kumar Sinha,12 wherein, this Court held that even in an ex-parte inquiry, it is the duty of the Inquiry Officer to examine the evidence presented by the Department to find out whether the unrebutted evidence is sufficient to hold that the charges are proved. The relevant observations made in Saroj Kumar Sinha13 are as follows:-', '\"28. An inquiry officer acting in a quasi-judicial authority is in the position of an independent adjudicator. He is not supposed to be a representative of the department/disciplinary authority/Government. His function is to examine the evidence presented by the Department, even in the absence of the delinquent official to see as to whether the unrebutted evidence is sufficient to hold that the charges are proved. In the present case the aforesaid procedure has not been observed. Since no oral evidence has been examined the documents have not been proved, and could not have been taken into consideration to conclude that the charges have been proved against the respondents.', '33. As noticed earlier in the present case not only the respondent has been denied access to documents sought to be relied upon against him, but he has been condemned unheard as the inquiry officer failed to fix any date for conduct of the enquiry. In other words, not a single witness has been examined in support of the charges levelled against the respondent. The High Court, therefore, has rightly observed that the entire proceedings are vitiated having been conducted in complete violation of the principles of natural justice and total disregard of fair play. The respondent never had any opportunity at any stage of the proceedings to offer an explanation against the allegations made in the charge-sheet.\"', '(emphasis supplied)', '16. In the case of Nirmala J. Jhala14, this Court held that evidence recorded in a preliminary inquiry cannot be used for a regular inquiry as the delinquent is not associated with it and the opportunity to cross-examine persons examined in preliminary inquiry is not given. Relevant extract thereof reads as under: -', '\"42. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Amalendu Ghosh v. North Eastern Railway [AIR 1960 SC 992] , held that the purpose of holding a preliminary inquiry in respect of a particular alleged misconduct is only for the purpose of finding a particular fact and prima facie, to know as to whether the alleged misconduct has been committed and on the basis of the findings recorded in preliminary inquiry, no order of punishment can be passed. It may be used only to take a view as to whether a regular disciplinary proceeding against the delinquent is required to be held.', '43. Similarly in Champaklal Chimanlal Shah v. Union of India [AIR 1964 SC 1854] a Constitution Bench of this Court while taking a similar view held that preliminary inquiry should not be confused with regular inquiry. The preliminary inquiry is not governed by the provisions of Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India. Preliminary inquiry may be held ex parte, for it is merely for the satisfaction of the Government though usually for the sake of fairness, an explanation may be sought from the government servant even at such an inquiry. But at that stage, he has no right to be heard as the inquiry is merely for the satisfaction of the Government as to whether a regular inquiry must be held. The Court further held as under : (AIR p. 1862, para 12)', '\"12. There must therefore be no confusion between the two enquiries and it is only when the government proceeds to hold a departmental enquiry for the purpose of inflicting on the government servant one of the three major punishments indicated in Article 311 that the government servant is entitled to the protection of that article [, nor prior to that].\"', '44. In Narayan Dattatraya Ramteerthakhar v. State of Maharashtra [(1997) 1 SCC 299 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 152 : AIR 1997 SC 2148] this Court dealt with the issue and held as under: \"a preliminary inquiry has nothing to do with the enquiry conducted after issue of charge-sheet. The preliminary enquiry is only to find out whether disciplinary enquiry should be initiated against the delinquent. Once regular enquiry is held under the Rules, the preliminary enquiry loses its importance and, whether preliminary enquiry was held strictly in accordance with law or by observing principles of natural justice of (sic) nor, remains of no consequence.\"', '45. In view of the above, it is evident that the evidence recorded in preliminary inquiry cannot be used in regular inquiry as the delinquent is not associated with it, and opportunity to cross-examine the persons examined in such inquiry is not given. Using such evidence would be violative of the principles of natural justice.', '(emphasis supplied)', '17. Thus, even in an ex-parte inquiry, it is sine qua non to record the evidence of the witnesses for proving the charges. Having tested the facts of the case at hand on the touchstone of the Rules of 1999, and the law as expounded by this Court in the cases of Roop Singh Negi15 and Nirmala J. Jhala16, we are of the firm view that the inquiry proceedings conducted against the appellant pertaining to charges punishable with major penalty, were totally vitiated and non-est in the eyes of law since no oral evidence whatsoever was recorded by the department in support of the charges.', '18. As a consequence, thereof, the High Court fell into grave error of law while interfering in the well-reasoned judgment rendered by the Tribunal whereby, the Tribunal had quashed the order imposing penalty upon the appellant.', '19. Resultantly, the impugned judgment dated 30th July, 2018 is hereby quashed and set aside and the order dated 5th June, 2015 rendered by the Public Service Tribunal, Uttar Pradesh is restored. The appellant is entitled to all consequential benefits.', '20. The monetary benefit flowing from this order shall be paid to the appellant within a period of two months from today, failing which, the said amount shall carry interest @ 6% per annum.', '21.

These appeals arise from the judgment dated 17th August, 2012 rendered by the Division Bench of High Court of Punjab and Haryana whereby, the intra-court appeals1 preferred by the appellants herein were dismissed and the judgment dated 11th August, 2011 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court was upheld. The Learned Single Judge rejected the Civil Writ Petitions2 preferred by the appellants for grant of benefits under the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988 and Assured Career Progression Scheme, 1998, by accounting for their entire service period including that in the work charged establishment.', '2. Shri P.S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants, vehemently and fervently contended that the Government of Punjab has on its own volition, extended the very same benefits of Proficiency Step-up to other employees situated at par with the appellants, and thus, the differential treatment meted out to the appellants tantamount to hostile and subjective discrimination, which is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.', 'In this regard, learned senior counsel drew the attention of this Court to the Policy Circular dated 13th March, 1996, issued by the Department of Irrigation and Power (Irrigation Personnel-III), Government of Punjab, whereby, it was decided that the Government Policy contained in the letter dated 7th May, 1993 would be relaxed and the services of the work-charged staff of Ranjit Sagar Dam would be regularised. He submitted that clause (a) of the said Policy Circular clearly provided that the past services rendered by the employees on work charged/daily basis will be treated as qualifying service for pensionary and all other consequential benefits.', '3. Learned senior counsel further referred to various communications and circulars, more specifically to the Circular dated 12th April, 2005 issued by the Chief Engineer, Irrigation Department, Punjab, whereby, it was communicated as below:-', '\"All the aforementioned judgements which have been allowed by the Hon\\'ble Courts in favour of the petitioners were filed by various categories of employees for counting of their work charge service rendered prior to regularisation of their services for granting 8/18 years of proficiency step-up(s). In this regard this be informed that how many similar employees of different categories had left who are entitled for the grant of proficiency step up(s) for 8/18 years after counting their work charge service rendered prior to their regularisation. After clarifying the position, the complete report be sent to this office within 15 days. In addition to aforesaid, this be also conveyed that by doing so from which date the official will be entitled for the grant of 8 and 18 years of proficiency step-up(s) and how much financial burden will have to be bore by the government. You will solely be liable for not sending the complete report as required aforesaid within the stipulated time.\"', '4. Learned senior counsel for the appellants, thus, submitted that the appellants herein are entitled to reliefs sought for in these appeals by reversing/modifying the judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge of the High Court as upheld by the learned Division Bench.', '5. During the course of submissions, Shri P.S. Patwalia had restricted the claims of the appellants to the benefits under the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988.', '6. Per contra, Shri Shadan Farasat, learned AAG representing the State, vehemently and fervently contested the submissions advanced by the counsel for the appellants and urged that the benefits under the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988 to employees situated at par with the appellants herein were extended only in the cases where such employees were granted the said relief in compliance of the orders passed by the courts in judicial proceedings. Nonetheless, Shri Farasat was not in a position to dispute the fact that the Circular dated 12th April, 2005 issued by the Chief Engineer, Irrigation Department, Punjab, clearly provides for the grant of Proficiency Step-up(s) to employees of different categories who were left out after the various judgments of the courts, without any court orders being in force qua such employees.', '7. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced at the bar and have perused the impugned judgments. With the assistance of learned counsel for the parties, we have thoroughly examined the material available on record.', '8. The primary issue that arises for consideration before this Court is whether the service rendered by the appellants herein as work charge employees prior to regularisation is to be accounted towards the grant of benefits under Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988, in view of the fact that other similarly situated employees have already been granted the same benefit.', '9. The fact that the appellants herein were regularised in service and the period spent by them in the work-charged establishment was ordered to be counted for qualifying service for pensionary and all other consequential benefits is not in dispute as the same is clearly discernible from the Policy Circular dated 13th March, 1996 referred to supra.3', 'However, a significant bulk of litigation in the form of writ petitions4 had ensued on behalf of the employees engaged in the work-charged establishment, who claimed that the services rendered by them as work charge employee should be counted for the grant of benefits under the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988 and the Assured Career Progression Scheme (ACPS), 1998 and their claims were accepted by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana but were restricted to only the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988. Out of these writ petitions5, the order passed in C.W.P. No. 219 of 2003, was challenged by the State of Punjab before this Court in SLP(C) No. 7798 of 2004, which stands dismissed vide order dated 28th April, 2004 and the order of the High Court was affirmed.', '10. A perusal of the impugned judgments would reveal that the Division Bench treated the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988 and the Assured Career Progression Scheme (ACPS), 1998 to be at par. However, on a perusal of the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge which has been affirmed by the Division Bench, it is clear that the learned Single Judge took note of the earlier judgment of the High Court, in relation to the same controversy passed in Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department, Punjab and Anr. v. President Sri Natha Singh, Thein Dam Workers Union (CITU) & Anr.6, which had approved the claims of the workcharge employees in respect of the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988.7 Nevertheless, the learned Single Judge while relying upon the judgment in the case of Punjab State Electricity Board and Ors. v. Jagjiwan Ram & Ors.8, denied the relief to the appellants herein.', '11. On examining the judgments rendered by the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court, we find that the precise connotations of the Government Circular dated 1st December, 1988, which had introduced the Proficiency Step-up Scheme were not considered in an apropos manner.', 'The fundamental distinction in the present case is that the Policy Circular whereby, the services of the appellants were regularised, gave a clear mandate that the services of the work charge employees would be regularised, and the past services of such employees would be treated as qualifying service for pensionary and all other consequential benefits. The High Court seems to have overlapped the Assured Career Progression Scheme (ACPS), 1998 and the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988 for denying relief to the appellants which is not justifiable by any stretch of imagination.', '12. This controversy was examined in a reference made to the Industrial Tribunal, Punjab9 in the case of President, Thein Dam Workers Union (CITU), Shahpur Kandi (Pathankot) v. Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department, Punjab & Anr.10 The Tribunal vide its order dated 10th August, 2005 held that in view of the regularisation policy dated 13th March, 1996, the work charge service of an employee before his regularisation is liable to be counted for grant of Proficiency Step-up(s).', 'A writ petition11 filed by the State against the said order of the Tribunal was dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court and the SLP12 preferred challenging the same, has been rejected by this Court vide order dated 19th October, 2010.

Ramulu Ammal (D) through LRS.', '[Civil Appeal No. 3034 of 2012]', 'Sanjay Karol, J.', '1. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Madras dated 22nd April, 2009 passed in S.A.No.10 of 2005. The judgment impugned in turn was passed in a first appeal preferred against judgment and decree dated 3rd December, 2003 passed by the Additional District Court-cum-Chief Judicial Magistrate, Fast Track Court No.V, Chengalpattu in A.S.No.35 of 2001 which confirmed the judgment and decree dated 13th September, 2001 of the Subordinate Judge, Tiruvallur in O.S.No.89 of 1995.', '2. The brief facts, putting the controversy in context are:-', '2.1 One Balu Reddy, was survived by his three sons viz., Venkatarama Reddy, Venkata Reddy @ Pakki Reddy1 and Chenga Reddy2. They enjoyed the property in question as coparceners to Hindu joint family property. The first of the three siblings, Venkatarama Reddy died leaving behind his son Markandeya Reddy as legal heir; the second, Venkata Reddy @ Pakki Reddy died leaving behind his daughter Govindammal as legal heir; and the third brother Chenga Reddy died issueless, with each of them having 1/3rd share in the undivided property. Chenga Reddy transferred his share in favour of Govindammal in the year 1963 by way of a settlement deed dated 5th May, 1963. It is urged that thereafter, Govindammal, enjoyed uninterrupted possession of the property to the extent of 2/3rd.', '2.2 In 1986 the original settlement deed in favour of Govindammal was given to Markandeya Reddy to bring into effect the 2/3rd share of Govindammal in the official records since at that time no partition by metes and bounds was effected and without prejudice to their rights, they had been cultivating random, separate portion(s) of the land. Such change was, allegedly never effected and neither were the documents returned to her. As such the suit for partition was filed on 30th March, 1995.', '2.3. Plaint', 'In the plaint following prayers were made:-', '\"(9) The plaintiffs therefore pray that this Hon\\'ble Court may be pleased to pass a decree. (a) for partition and separate possession of 2/3rd share from out of the suit properties in favour of the plaintiffs and to put the plaintiffs in possession of the same. (b) directing the defendant to pay cost of the suit and (c) such other reliefs as this Honourable court may deem fit proper in the circumstances of the case and render justice accordingly.\"', '2.4 Written Statement', '❖ In the written statement filed by the original defendants, it has been averred that in the year 1984 the Panchayat decided on a division between the parties giving one-half of the property to both. Patta was not separated for 48-78 acres. His right and title extend to 25½ acres.', '❖ Survey No.201/1 was incorrectly included in the name of the defendant, and when change thereof, was applied for by Govindammal, the same was carried out without any objection. Survey Nos.201/L and 201/B were incorrectly 4| Civil Appeal 3034 of 2012 shown against the name of Govindammal and actually belonged to the defendant.', '❖ There is a lake on the property to which the defendant had half right.', '❖ The plaintiff is not in joint possession of properties and is not entitled to the relief of partition.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE TRIAL COURT', '3. The Trial Court framed the following issues:', '\"1. Whether the marking of the suit properties are correct or not?', '2. Whether the suit properties are properties of the plaintiff?', '3. Whether the settlement deed executed in the year 1963 have been brought into force?', '4. Whether the partition made in the year 1964 is genuine?', '5. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for partition as prayed?', '6. What are the other relief?\"', 'Having considered the first four issues, the Court, in answer to the fifth issue, concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to 2/3rd share of the property. The same was awarded with costs.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE FIRST APPELLATE COURT', '4. The learned First Appellate Court found for its consideration one solitary issue which was the correctness of the judgment and decree of the Trial Court. Having considered the evidence on record, the conclusion arrived at is as under:-', '\"Therefore, for the above said facts, I finally decided that Ex.A1 registered settlement deed was executed for valuable consideration and as such the deceased Govindammal has got 2/3rd share in the suit properties on the basis of Ex.A1 registered settlement deed and as such her legal heirs, i.e. the respondents/plaintiff are entitled to get 2/3rd share in the suit properties as prayed for in the plaint.', 'Earlier, I decided that the appellant/second defendant has miserably failed to prove that the suit properties were divided by states and bounds orally in the year 1964 and mutation of revenue records in the name of the deceased first defendants. Thiru Markandeya Reddy would not affect the rights of the respondent/plaintiff over the suit properties and also in view of the registered settlement deed dated 5.5.1963 the respondent/plaintiff are entitled to get 2/3rd share in the suit properties as prayed for in the plaint and as such there is no reason to interfere with the findings of the trial court and also no merit in this Civil appeal. In view of the above said findings, I come to the conclusion that this civil appeal is liable to be dismissed and I answered this point accordingly.\"', 'PROCEEDINGS IN SECOND APPEAL', '5. Substantial questions of law, arising in the appeal were recorded in para 6 of the impugned judgment. It reads as under:', '\"1. Whether the courts below have considered the material evidence in the case and have properly applied the law relating to consideration and appreciation of family arrangement while considering the defence put forward by the defendant in this regard?', '2. Whether the courts below have properly considered the material evidence in the case namely, Ex.A1, which is a gift (settlement) deed gifting undivided share in the coparcenary property?', '3. Whether the Courts below properly considered the material evidence, namely Ex.B16 and Ex.B17, which have been brought into existence by the plaintiffs pending the suit which contain the admission to lean towards the family arrangement?\"', '6. The High Court concluded that, (a) the learned Courts below correctly concluded that oral partition had indeed not taken place; (b) that the Courts below committed an error in holding the settlement deed to be valid and thereby awarding 2/3rd share in favour of the original plaintiffs i.e., heirs of Govindammal; (c) that Ex.B16 and B17, cannot be taken as sufficient evidence to prove oral partition. In view of this conclusion, the judgment and decree of the Courts below were modified to the extent that:-', '\"Accordingly, the plaintiffs being the legal representatives/legal heirs of Venkata Reddy are entitled to one half share and the defendant being the sole widow of D1 Markandeya Reddy s/o Venkata Rama Reddy is entitled to another half share in all the suit properties. Accordingly, preliminary decree shall follow.\"', 'RIVAL CONTENTIONS', '7. We have heard Mr. Ragenth Basant and Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned senior counsel for the appellants, and Mr. V. Prabhakar, learned senior counsel for the respondents. We have also perused the written submissions filed by the parties.', '8. The appellants submit chiefly, as under:', '8.1 The Courts have correctly and concurrently rejected the defence of oral partition; thus, this issue has obtained finality;', '8.2 What flows from the above is that the rights under the settlement deed of 1963 have not been given up and were enforceable. However, the High Court holding that this deed was actually a gift deed and not a settlement deed, was a position being not open to the Court. This instrument and the rights flowing therefrom have been admitted in the written statement, wherein a specific defence has been taken stating thus:', '\"The right under the 1963 settlement deed were given up before the Panchayatdars in view of the family arrangements.\"', '8.3 Once such a defence of family arrangement stood rejected, the plaintiff has to necessarily succeed. This is more so in the view, that the High Court would not ordinarily disturb concurrent findings of fact.', '8.4 The settlement deed in favour of Govindammal was executed since she had been looking after the food and shelter needs of her father and uncle and, subsequently, she would perform charitable work therewith. Such documents have been repeatedly held to be settlement deeds and not gift deeds.', '8.5 In furtherance of the submissions made the appellants have submitted a compilation of case laws.', '9. Mr. V. Prabhakar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, submitted as under:-', '9.1 The nomenclature of the document hardly makes any difference. It is the contents of the document, that are to be taken into consideration. The document although, may be styled as a settlement deed, was, in fact, a gift deed.', '9.2 The intention has been manifested by both express language and necessary implication. There is no reservation of power of life estate or vesting rights.', \"9.3 The appellants have never questioned the nomenclature of the document and that the document in question, was not a gift deed. The term 'settlement' is used in terms of settlement of a dispute.\", \"9.4 There is no element of consideration in Ex.A1 (settlement deed) and love and affection are not elements of 'consideration' under the law.\", \"9.5 Documentary evidence such as separate pattas, kist, receipts, adangals, drive home the point of oral partition. The exclusive enjoyment of properties under separate pattas and separate sub- divisions cannot be 'brushed aside.'\", 'OUR VIEW', '10. In the above backdrop, the question for us to decide is whether, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court was justified in overturning the concurrent findings of the Trial as well as the First Appellate Court. The second question to be considered is whether the deed executed, which gave rise to the present property dispute, was a gift deed or a deed of settlement.', '11. The settlement deed executed in favour of Govindammal, which is said to have given her right over 2/3rd of the subject property, is reproduced for reference:', '\"DOCUMENT NO.485/1963', 'Settlement deed for Rs. 5000/- This settlement deed has been executed on 5th May 1963 in favor of Govindammal wife of Thondi Krishna Chettiar resident of Chengalpattu District, Uthukottai sub district, Katturamanathapuram panchayat board area by Pakki Reddi(1) and Chenga Reddi sons of Boyee Reddi of Ramanathapuram village that with all of our consent and good faith and bonafidely execute this settlement deed that you are the only daughter of Bagi Reddi and that we do not have any wife or children or legal heirs and you happened to be the daughter of our elder brother Chenga Reddi and that since we do not have any wife or children and you happened to have looked after us very well till now ad that herein after you will look after our food and shelter needs and in the belief that you would do all the charitable work', 'We execute this settlement deed in respect of properties worth Rs. 5000/- in favor of you and give possession to you today itself and therefore from today onwards you have the exclusive, right, title and possession in those properties, you, your heirs, successors and assigns will have the exclusive rights, title and possession and we assure that there is no encumbrances in those properties and any encumbrances find in future, we would settle them at our own expenses. The properties given to you this settlement deed are, value of the property at Amayappanpakam village is Rs. 500/-.', 'Out of our inherited property of 4.32 acres of land in dry survey number 176 in Amambakkam village, Ammampakkam panchayat board area, Uthukottai sub district and Chengalpattu district we have two third share after giving one third share to Markandeyan son of our elder brother and out 4.39 acres of dry land in survey number 221 with patta number 558 in Seethanperi Amaran village in Amapakkam panchayat board area worth Rs. 4000/- we have 2/3rd share leaving 1/3rd share to Markendeyan son of our elder brother and out of 8.41 acres in survey number 201 we have a right of 2/3rd share leaving 1/3rd share to Markendeyan son of our elder brother.', 'Out of 2.69 acres of land in dry survey number 201, we have 2/3rd right leaving 1/3rd to Markendeyan son of our elder brother and out of 9.89 acres in Ramanathapuram village in Ramanathapuram panchayat board in Uthukottai sub-district, Chengalpattu district is Rs.500 /-. 17.74 acres in survey number 163 which is in our possession and enjoyment.', 'North of the street, east of the housing plot of Subbi Reddi and Govinda Reddy, west of the dry land of Thondhi Krishna Reddy and others west of the pattai in the middle, a house with measurement east to west about 250 feet, north to south about 200 feet in which we have 2.3rd right leaving 1/3rd to Markendeyan son of our elder brother and out of 2 acre 40 cents in survey number 160 we have 2/3rd right leaving 1/3rd to Markendeyan son of our elder brother including the standing palm trees, tamarind trees, and neem trees and other standing palm trees, and neem trees and other standing trees over which we have 2/3rd right leaving 1/3rd to Markendeyan son of our elder brother. This settlement deed has been executed by us with all our consent and good faith and bonafidely. xxxLeft hand Thumb impression of Baghi Reddy and Left hand thumb impression of Renga Reddy. Sd.', 'Witnesses.\"', '12. Although submissions have been advanced by learned senior counsel for the parties on a variety of issues, in our considered view, the scope for interference of this Court is limited only to the question as formulated in para 10.', \"13. The dispute, as is evident from the above, hinges on whether the deed executed granting Govindammal 2/3rd share of the property is a gift deed or a settlement deed. In making such a determination, it is imperative to examine the meaning of 'gift' and 'settlement'. The Transfer of Property Act, 18823 defines 'gift' as: -\", '122. \"Gift\" defined.-\"Gift\" is the transfer of certain existing moveable or immoveable property made voluntarily and without consideration, by one person, called the donor, to another, called the donee, and accepted by or on behalf of the donee.', 'Acceptance when to be made.-Such acceptance must be made during the lifetime of the donor and while he is still capable of giving. If the donee dies before acceptance, the gift is void.', \"The term 'settlement' does not find a place in the TPA. It is defined under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. Section 2 (24) reads:-\", 'Settlement.-\"Settlement\" means any non-testamentary disposition, in writing, of movable or immovable property made-', '(a) in consideration of marriage,', '(b) for the purpose of distributing property of the settlor among his family or those for whom he desires to provide, or for the purpose of providing for some person dependent on him, or', '(c) for any religious or charitable purpose; \\'disposition\\' for reference, means a devise \"intended to comprehend a mode by which property can pass, whether by act of parties or by an act of the law\" and \"includes transfer and charge of property\".4', '14. Disagreeing with the Courts below, the High Court held that the deed executed was, in fact, a gift deed. The reasoning in this regard is:-', '\"20. From a conspectus, therefore, of the definitions contained in the dictionaries and the books regarding a gift or an adequate consideration, the inescapable conclusion that follows is that \"consideration\" means a reasonable equivalent or other valuable benefit passed on by the promisor to the promise or by the transferor to the transferee. Similarly, when the word \"consideration\" is qualified by the word adequate it makes consideration stronger so as to make it sufficient and valuable having regard to the facts, and circumstances of the case.', 'It has also been seen from the discussions of the various authorities mentioned above that a gift is undoubtedly a transfer which does not contain any element of consideration in any shape or form. In fact, where there is any equivalent or benefit measured in terms of money in respect of a gift the transaction ceases to be a gift and acquires a different colour. Love, affection, spiritual benefit and many other factors may enter in the intention of the donor to make a gift but these filial considerations cannot be called or held to be legal considerations as understood by law. It is manifest, therefore, that the passing of monetary consideration is completely foreign to the concept of a gift having regard to the nature, character and the circumstances under which such a transfer takes place.', '21. In fact, the legislature has made its intention clear that gift is excluded by qualifying the word \"consideration\" by the adjective \"adequate.\" Assuming that love and affection, spiritual benefit or similar other factors may amount to consideration for the gift, the word \"adequate\" is wholly inapplicable to and inconsistent with the concept of a gift because it is impossible to measure love and affection, the sentiments or feelings of the donor by any standard yardstick or barometer. The words \"adequate consideration\" clearly postulate that consideration must be capable of being measured in terms of money value having regard to the market price of the property, the value that it may fetch if sold, the value of similar lands in the vicinity , so on and so forth.', 'In the instant case, the legislature by using the word \"adequate\" to qualify the word \"consideration\" has completely ruled out and excluded gift from the ambit of clause (b) of the proviso. In these circumstances, therefore, the argument of Mr. Kacker that by not expressly excluding gift, clause(b) of the proviso includes gift cannot be accepted particularly in the face of the clear and unambiguous language used by clause (b) of the proviso in describing the nature of transaction as one for adequate consideration.\"', \"The primary reason, as it appears from the above extract for the High Court holding that the deed in question was in fact a gift deed and not one of settlement, is that it found that the element of 'adequate consideration' was missing and instead, the transfer was effected out of love and affection for Govindammal.\", '15. Since the point which the High Court in its wisdom found to be the determining factor qua the nature of the deed is the element of consideration and its adequateness, let us consider the same.', '15.1 It shall be useful to refer to certain provisions of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The relevant part of the interpretation clause thereof says -', '\"2...', '(d) When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise;', '(e) Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement;', '(f) Promises which form the consideration or part of the consideration for each other are called reciprocal promises;.\"', \"15.2 The discussion regarding the meaning of the word 'consideration' made in CIT v. Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority,5 is relevant for our purposes here:\", '\"165. The term \"consideration\" however is broader. The plain meaning is a monetary payment, for something obtained, in the form of goods, or services. In CCE v. Fiat India (P) Ltd. [CCE v. Fiat India (P) Ltd., (2012) 9 SCC 332 : (2012) 12 SCR 975] this Court explained the meaning of that term : (SCC pp. 360-61, paras 68-73)', '\"68. Consideration means something which is of value in the eye of the law, moving from the plaintiff, either of benefit to the plaintiff or of detriment to the defendant. In other words, it may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility, given, suffered or undertaken by the other, as observed in Currie v. Misa [Currie v. Misa, (1875) LR 10 Exch 153].', '69. Webster\\'s Third New International Dictionary (unabridged) defines, \"consideration\" thus: \\'Something that is legally regarded as the equivalent or return given or suffered by one for the act or promise of another.\\'', '70. In Vol. 17 of Corpus Juris Secundum (pp. 420-21 and 425) the import of \"consideration\" has been described thus:', '\\'Various definitions of the meaning of \"consideration\" are to be found in the textbooks and judicial opinions. A sufficient one, as stated in Corpus Juris and which has been quoted and cited with approval is \"a benefit to the party promising or a loss or detriment to the party to whom the promise is made.\" At common law every contract not under seal requires a consideration to support it, that is, as shown in the definition above, some benefit to the promisor, or some detriment to the promisee.\\'', '71. In Salmond on Jurisprudence, the word \"consideration\" has been explained in the following words:', \"'A consideration in its widest sense is the reason, motive or inducement, by which a man is moved to bind himself by an agreement. It is for nothing that he consents to impose an obligation upon himself, or to abandon or transfer a right. It is in consideration of such and such a fact that he agrees to bear new burdens or to forego the benefits which the law already allows him.'\", '73. From a conspectus of decisions and dictionary meaning, the inescapable conclusion that follows is that \"consideration\" means a reasonable equivalent or other valuable benefit passed on by the promisor to the promisee or by the transferor to the transferee. Similarly, when the word \"consideration\" is qualified by the word \"sole\", it makes consideration stronger so as to make it sufficient and valuable having regard to the facts, circumstances and necessities of the case.\"', '(Emphasis supplied)', '15.3 Chidambara Iyer & Ors. v. P.S. Renga Iyer6 which cites similar authorities is also important for our consideration.', \"15.4 What flows from the above-cited judgments as also provisions of law, is that 'consideration' need not always be in monetary terms. It can be in other forms as well. In the present case, it is seen that the transfer of property in favour of Govindammal was in recognition of the fact that she had been taking care of the transferors and would continue to do so while also using the same to carry out charitable work. Although the deed stands reproduced supra, for immediate recollection the relevant extract is once again reproduced hereinbelow:\", '\"execute this Settlement deed that you are the only daughter of Bagi Reddi and that we do not have any wife or children or legal heirs and you happened to be the daughter of our elder brother Chenga Reddi and that since we do not have any wife or children and you happened to have looked after us very well till now and that herein after you will look after our food and shelter needs and in the belief that you would do all the charitable work.\"', \"15.5 In that view of the matter, the High Court has erred in taking such a constricted view of 'consideration', especially taking note of the fact that this settlement was between the members of a family.\", '16. The above conclusion apart, it was also to be demonstrated by the High Court that the reversal of concurrent findings by the Courts below was justified. The jurisdiction to interfere in findings where the Courts below have been ad idem, is limited and such limitation is well expounded. We may only refer to a few authorities.', '16.1 Dalveer Bhandari J. in Gurdev Kaur v. Kaki7 referred to various earlier judgments in the following manner-', '\"55. This Court again reminded the High Court in Commr., HRCE v. P. Shanmugama [(2005) 9 SCC 232] that the High Court has no jurisdiction in second appeal to interfere with the finding of facts.', '56. Again, this Court in State of Kerala v. Mohd. Kunhi [(2005) 10 SCC 139] has reiterated the same principle that the High Court is not justified in interfering with the concurrent findings of fact. This Court observed that, in doing so, the High Court has gone beyond the scope of Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure.', '73. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as early as in 1890 stated that there is no jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal on the ground of an erroneous finding of fact, however gross or inexcusable the error may seem to be, and they added a note of warning that no court in India has power to add to, or enlarge, the grounds specified in Section 100.', '81. Despite repeated declarations of law by the judgments of this Court and the Privy Council for over a century, still the scope of Section 100 has not been correctly appreciated and applied by the High Courts in a large number of cases. In the facts and circumstances of this case the High Court interfered with the pure findings of fact even after the amendment of Section 100 CPC in 1976. The High Court would not have been justified in interfering with the concurrent findings of fact in this case even prior to the amendment of Section 100 CPC. The judgment of the High Court is clearly against the provisions of Section 100 and in no uncertain terms clearly violates the legislative intention.\"', '(Emphasis supplied)', '16.2 A Bench of three learned Judges in V. Ramachandra Ayyar v. Ramalingam Chettiar8, as recently followed in Nazir Mohammed v. J. Kamala9, observed:-', '\"11. It is well known that as early as 1890, the Privy Council had occasion to consider this aspect of the matter in Mussummai Durga Choudhrain v. Jawahir Singh Choudhri [17 IA 122] . In that case, it was urged before the Privy Council, relying upon the decision of the Calcutta and Allahabad High Courts in Futtehma Begum v. Mohamed Ausur [ILR 9 Cal 309] and Nivath Singh v. Bhikki Singh [ILR 7 All 649] respectively, that the High Court would be within its jurisdiction in holding that where the lower appellate court has clearly misapprehended what the evidence before it was, and has been led to discard or not give sufficient weight to other evidence to which it is not entitled, the High Court can interfere under Section 100.', 'This contention was rejected by the Privy Council and it was observed that an erroneous finding of fact is a different thing from an error or defect in procedure, and that there is no jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal on the ground of an erroneous finding of fact, however gross or inexcusable the error may seem to be. Their Lordships added that nothing can be clearer than the declaration in the Code of Civil Procedure that no second appeal will lie except on the grounds specified in Section 584 (corresponding to Section 100 of the present Code), and they uttered a word of warning that no court in India or elsewhere has power to add to or enlarge those grounds. Since 1890, this decision has been treated as a leading decision on the question about the jurisdiction of the High Court in dealing with questions of facts in second appeals.\"', '16.3 The principles regarding the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 have been recently summarised by this Court in Suresh Lataruji Ramteke v. Sau. Sumanbai Pandurang Petkar10. Referring to Santosh Hazari v. Purushottam Tiwari11 it was held that a substantial question of law, which is sine qua non for the maintainability of a second appeal, shall be so, if:-', '\"a) Not previously settled by law of land or a binding precedent.', 'b) Material bearing on the decision of case; and', '(c) New point raised for the first time before the High Court is not a question involved in the case unless it goes to the root of the matter. Therefore, it will depend on facts of each case.\"', \"16.4 In our considered view, none of the aspects referred to above appear to be met in this case, justifying the High Court's overturning of concurrent findings. Govindammal (now her heirs) is indeed entitled to 2/3rd share in the property.\", '17. In light of the above discussion, the appeal succeeds and is, accordingly, allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside and the findings of the Court below, are restored. Pending applications if any, shall stand disposed of.', '......................J. (C.T.

The core issue in the present case is whether the appellant, as a family member of a land-loser, whose land was acquired for the Kaiga Atomic Power Project, had legally secured the job as the sonin- law, of the land-loser. Also if the findings recorded in the impugned judgment valid and reasonable.', '5. On 07.05.1990, the appellant claims to have married one Smt. Ganga, the daughter of Bellanna Venkanna Gowda of Devkar Village, who was the owner of land under Survey No.71/2. A portion of the said land was acquired for the Kaiga Atomic Power Project. Accordingly, the land-loser - Bellanna Venkanna Gowda applied for a certificate for availing a job for his son-in-law - Ganapati Bhikarao Naik (the appellant), as part of rehabilitation package. Such a Certificate was granted in favour of the appellant on 21.08.1990 (Annexure R/2) by the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Kali River Project, Dandeli (Uttar Kannada).', \"The appellant was then interviewed for the job and was given appointment as a Helper in the Corporation. In the Attestation Form, furnished by the appellant to the Management, the name of Smt. Ganga was shown as the employee's wife. The said information was counter-signed by the Chief Administrative Officer of the Management. In the Ration Card issued to the appellant, Smt. Ganga was mentioned as the appellant's wife, along with other family members.\", \"6. However, matrimonial differences cropped up and Smt. Ganga shifted to her father's house. Even at that stage, on 24.05.1997, the land-loser in his communication to the Senior Manager (Administration & Labour Relation) (Annexure R/6) stated that although his daughter Smt. Ganga, being mentally disturbed, is currently not staying with his son-in-law in recent times, neither he nor his family members, have any objection for confirmation of the job of the appellant, at the Kaiga Atomic Power Project.\", '7. The appellant around that period, filed an application under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 seeking divorce from Smt. Ganga. The said proceeding concluded with a consent decree of divorce granted on 16.06.2001.', \"8. In the meantime, on account of the estrangement between the appellant and his wife and the divorce proceeding initiated by appellant, his father-in-law made complaints, which led to issuance of the charge memo dated 10.01.2000, with the allegation that the appellant is not married to Smt. Ganga (the daughter of the landloser) and therefore he is disentitled to secure the job intended for a land-loser's family member. The resultant inquiry was answered against appellant and the said decision led to the termination order dated 19.04.2002. The appellate authority and the revisional authority upheld the termination order, which prompted the appellant, to seek a Reference under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.\", \"9. The Central Government Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court in the Reference i.e., CR No. 66 of 2007, from the evidence of the witnesses concluded that the appellant had married Smt. Ganga (the daughter of the land-loser - Bellanna Venkanna Gowda) but when the matrimonial relationship became strained and divorce proceeding was initiated, Smt. Ganga applied for maintenance, claiming to be the appellant's wife.\", \"The Labour Court accordingly concluded that this itself would be enough to establish that the appellant had married Smt. Ganga (the daughter of the land-loser - Bellanna Venkanna Gowda) and at the instance of the said land-loser, he was given appointment under the prevalent Scheme intended for the landloser's family member. The Reference was accordingly answered favouring the appellant and the following Award was passed:\", '\"AWARD The reference is allowed holding that the action of the management of Nuclear Power Corporation Ltd., Kaiga in imposing the penalty of removal from service on Shri Ganapthi B Naik w.e.f. 19.04.2002 is illegal and not justified and that he is entitle for reinstatement with full back wages, continuity of service and all other consequential benefits that he could have received in the absence of the impugned order of removal from service.\"', '10. The aggrieved Management then filed the W.P. No. 71540 of 2012 (L-TER) to challenge the said Award. The Writ Court had no occasion to stay the Award and instead on 06.06.2014, passed an interim order to ensure remittance of wages payable to the appellant. However under the impugned final judgment dated 16.12.2020 the learned Judge reached the conclusion that the appellant had misrepresented that he is the son-in-law of the land- loser (Bellanna Venkanna Gowda) and secured the job by playing fraud with the Management.', '11. The above conclusion of the learned Single Judge was reached without appropriately considering the divorce proceeding between the appellant and his wife - Ganga. The Court also overlooked the family details recorded by the employer (Annexure R/4) which indicates Smt. Ganga as the wife of the employee. The Ration Card also has the same family details of the appellant.', '12. The relevant materials reflecting the marriage of the appellant with Smt. Ganga was however ignored by the Writ Court. The Court also failed to appreciate that the learned Labour Court reached the factual conclusion, after due consideration of the material evidence. Such factual finding of the Labour Court should not normally be disturbed by a Writ Court without compelling reason. Such reasons are absent. Therefore we feel that the Award in favour of the appellant, granted by the Labour Court, was erroneously disturbed by the learned Single Judge.', \"13. The above discussion persuades us to hold that the appellant is entitled to relief, in terms of the Labour Court's Award dated 09.08.2012 with consequential service benefits. But allowing backwages may not be justified.\", 'It is therefore made clear that the reinstated employee, shall not be entitled to any back wages from 16.12.2020, when the learned Single Judge set aside the Award, till he is reinstated. However, the gap period i.e. 16.12.2020 till reinstatement, should be taken into account for all other service benefits. The appellant is ordered to be reinstated in service, within four weeks from today.', '14. With the above, the appeals stand allowed leaving the parties to bear their own cost.', '......................J. (Hrishikesh Roy)', '......................J. (S.V.N.

Om Parkash', '[Civil Appeal No(s). 4393/2010]', 'Hrishikesh Roy, J.', '1. Heard Mr. Kailash Vasudev, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant(s). Also heard Mr. Jaideep Gupta, learned Amicus Curiae assisted by Mr. Kunal Chatterjee, learned counsel for the respondent.', '2. The challenge here to the judgment and order dated 26.06.2008 in the LPA No.6/2003 of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh whereunder, the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 21.05.2003 was upheld by the Division Bench. Through the said judgment, the termination of the respondent ordered by the appellant(s) on 25.06.1996 was found to be unsustainable on the ground of not providing due opportunity to the delinquent. The learned Single Judge set aside the penalty of removal from service granting all consequential benefits to the delinquent. The Court however observed that the employers were at liberty to proceed to conduct inquiry on the charges in terms of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Staff) Regulation, 1960 (for short \"LIC Staff Regulation\", and take necessary action.', '3. The disciplinary authority while ordering removal from service of the respondent through the order dated 25.06.1996 (Annexure P-1) considered the absence from duty by the respondent to be a case of abandonment of service under Regulation 39(4)(iii) read with Explanation 1 of the LIC Staff Regulation. The order notes that the delinquent failed to respond to the notice(s) issued to him.', \"Moreover his whereabouts were not known for over 90 days, as specified in the LIC Staff Regulation. The respondent who was serving as an Assistant Administrative Officer in the LIC, since 25.9.1995 absented himself from duties without informing his employer. The LIC's letters addressed to him to resume duties remained unanswered by the delinquent. Then the chargesheet-cumshow cause notice was issued on 14.02.1996 proposing his removal from service. But the same was also not answered.\", '4. The Authority therefore considered it to be a case of abandonment of service and by invocation of powers under Regulation 39(4)(iii) ordered from removal of the delinquent. The relevant part of the Regulation reads as under:-', '\"39 (4) (iii) Where an employee has abandoned his post, the disciplinary authority may consider the circumstances of the case and pass such orders thereon as it deems fit.', 'Explanations: 1. For the purpose of this regulation, an employee shall be deemed to have abandoned his post if he absents himself from duty without leave or overstays his leave for a continous period of ninety days without any intimation therefore in writing.', '2. All communications under this regulation and copies of orders passed there under may be delivered personally to the employee if he is attending office; otherwise they shall be sent by registered post to the address noted in the service record. Where such communications or copies of orders cannot be served on him personally or by registered post, copies thereof shall be affixed on the notice board of the office in which the employee is employed, and on such affixing such communications and orders shall be deemed to have been properly served on him.\"', '5. Assailing the judgment of the High Court granting relief to the delinquent, Mr. Kailash Vasudev, learned Senior Counsel would point out that notice(s) were issued on 06.10.1995, 06.11.1995 and 19.12.1995 to the respondent prior to the chargesheet-cum-show cause notice on 14.02.1996. In those, the delinquent was informed about his unauthorized absence from office with effect from 25.09.1995 and requiring him to rejoin services immediately or action would be taken against him under the LIC Staff Regulation.', \"This was followed by chargesheet-cum-show cause notice which reflected the endorsement of the Postal Authorities to the communication dated 06.11.1995 to the effect that on enquiry it was learnt that the respondent had abandoned his job and left his place of residence. As all the notice(s) remained unanswered by the delinquent, the authorities invoked the powers under Regulation 39 (1)(f) and ordered delinquent's removal from service.\", '6. When the appeal of the delinquent was rejected by the Appellate Authority through order dated 19.08.1997, the respondent filed the writ petition resulting in the impugned orders of the Single Judge and Division Bench of the High Court.', '7.1. Mr. Kailash Vasudev, learned Senior Counsel would firstly submit that the appellant(s) had taken all steps to serve notice on the delinquent who was not to be found since 25.09.1995 and therefore treated it to be a case of abandonment of service. The termination of service was accordingly ordered, under the Regulation 39(4)(iii).', '7.2 It is next pointed out that around that period, the respondent secured employment as AG-III Depot in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on 14.04.1997 and although this was an important indication of abandonment of service by the respondent, he failed to disclose the same in the Writ Petition No.41 of 1998, which subsequently came to be filed before the High Court on 05.01.1998.', '7.3 The Senior Counsel submits that the respondent absented from duty for 90 days without intimation to his employer and since the notice(s) addressed to the delinquent remained unanswered, conducting an inquiry into the charge of unauthorized absence was an impossibility. Therefore, the employer had rightly treated it to be a case of abandonment of service and terminated the respondent.', \"8. The respondent despite notice, was un-represented and accordingly Mr. Jaideep Gupta, learned Senior Counsel was requested to assist the Court. Mr. Gupta adverts to the circumstances under which the respondent's services were dispensed with by the appellant(s) and points out that service of notice as claimed by the appellant(s), may have to be treated with caution as the concerned notice(s) were sent to different addresses.\", '9. On the above aspect, it is discernible that three notice(s) were sent to the permanent address. In response to the second notice dated 06.11.1995 which returned back to the appellant(s), the postal remarks in Hindi reads as under:', '\"pata karne par pata chala hai ki praptkarta kahin se naukari chodkar chala gaya hai. R.L. wapas ki jati hai\" [English Translation: on enquiry it has come to know that the consignee has left job and gone. R.L is returned herewith]\"', '10. Importantly, the respondent secured employment with the FCI on 14.04.1997 and although his Writ Petition was filed six months after securing the new job, the employment with the FCI was concealed in the Writ Petition. If this vital aspect was known the High Court possibly would have taken a different view and the respondent abandoning his job with the LIC, could have been easily inferred.', '11. Relief was granted to the respondent by the High Court on the ground that the termination order was passed without affording a reasonable opportunity or conducting an inquiry into the charge of absence from duty. But in granting such relief, the Court overlooked that it was a case of the respondent abandoning his services without informing his employer about his whereabouts. Subsequently, it came to light that he joined the FCI on 09.05.1997.', '12. Such conduct of the respondent could not have been condoned by the employer and therefore, in our assessment, treating the respondent to have abandoned his service and taking appropriate action against him, in terms of the LIC Staff Regulation, cannot be faulted. It is also necessary for us to say that as the delinquent was guilty of suppression of the fact of his employment with the FCI, he was disentitled to equitable relief from the High Court in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution.', '13. With the above conclusion, the High Court in our assessment, erred in granting relief to the respondent by allowing the Writ Petition. The impugned order is accordingly set aside and quashed. With this, the appeal stands allowed leaving the parties to bear their own cost.', '....................J. [Hrishikesh Roy]', '....................J. [S.V.N.
